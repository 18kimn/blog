# personal website for nathan kim

Has some of my current work, some fun with web
design/development, and an opportunity for myself to learn
basics in a lot of JS tools.

Hosted at [nathan-kim.org](https://nathan-kim.org). You can
tinker with this by:

```
git clone https://github.com/18kimn/blog
cd blog
npm install
npm run dev
```

(Ignore that and do it your own way if you're familiar with
Node projects)

This site is built with Svelte!
