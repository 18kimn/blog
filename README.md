# personal website for nathan kim

Has some of my current work, some fun with web design/development, and an opportunity for myself to learn basics in a lot of JS tools. 

Hosted at [https://nathankim.name](https://nathankim.name). You can tinker with this by cloning this repo and running `npm run start`. 

Most of this is built in Gatsby.js and React, with viz/animations in d3.js and React Spring. Click [here](https://nathankim.name/writing/about) for more info on the making of the site.
