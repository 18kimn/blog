See\n<a href=\"https://github.com/18kimn/imf_loans/raw/main/text/paper.pdf\">here</a> to\nread a paper that is essentially a long-form explanation of this same\nblog post, minus the notes here on learning code.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://imfdispossession.info\" width=\"90%\" height={800}>\n  </iframe>\n  <br />\n  <a href=\"https://imfdispossession.info\"> To view the full visualization, click here.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>Under the stated purpose of ensuring loan repayment and financial\nstability, the IMF maintains a policy of <em>conditionality</em> with\n<strong>Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs)</strong></p>\n<p>My project focuses on specifically the stipulation to move the country\ntowards the export of manufactured goods. John Smith contends in\n<em>Imperialism in the Twenty-First Century</em> that these transformed trade\nrelationships recapitulate old forms of economic subjugation: where\ncolonizers in the metropole would extract resources from periphery\ncolonies that they had formal control over, today the Global North\nextracts manufactured goods from the Global South. Laborers in the\nGlobal South produce these goods but are provided often-inhumane\nwages, while the value from these goods is realized in the Global\nNorth both as GDP and as corporate profit.</p>\n<p>How do the import-export relationships John Smith discusses come to\nbe? My project locates one answer in the IMF&#39;s predatory lending\npractices and policy packages. This turn not only asks us to consider\nthe international policy maneuvers creating long-term economic\nsubjugation but also the racial logic of debt behind them. I wrote\nabout this in the paper linked above as a form of <em>racialized\naccumulation by dispossession,</em> or a part of the violent social\nprocesses privatizing public and indigenous resources to generate\nprofit. I contend that IMF loans in particular are a manifestation of\ndebts that cannot be repaid, not because there will always be\noutstanding loan amounts but because SAPs create new dependency\nrelationships from the Global South to the Global North -- social\ndebts that are meant to be in place forever. The implementaiton of\nthese permanent social debts rely on what Denise Ferreira da Silva\nterms <em>analytics of raciality</em> that cast some to lack moral and\nintellectual attributes necessary to be proper economic subjects.\nDebts that cannot be repaid require improper economic subjects for\nwhom supposedly universal rules do not apply.</p>\n<p>This map displays these relationships by showing loan recipient\ncountries in red, each recipientâ€™s top five increased export\ndestinations over the next five years in blue, and lines connecting\nthese countries to show the flow of goods from the Global South to\nGlobal North. Users can zoom in with the mouse wheel or by\ndouble-clicking, flick or slowly drag to move the map, and change the\nyear displayed through the slider at the top of the page.</p>\n<p>This project represented a challenge for me. I had previously worked\nin d3.js (see a project <a href=\"korean-music-map.info\">here</a>), but this\nproject still meant overcoming both technical and academic hurdles to\nturn something coherent in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The enter-update-exit paradigm and selection paradigms:</strong> I\npreviously wrote that these essential paradigms of d3 were what I\nfocused on and tried to grasp as I hashed out another visualization\nproject. But even as I began making this map, I found myself\nforgetting the order of first selecting, then adding data, then\nentering, then appending elements. My previous project did not\nreally heavily on the enter-update-exit paradigm, so this wasn&#39;t a\nlarge concern then, but this project requires continual update of\nselections as the user changes the year that the loan was received.\n<a href=\"https://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/\">This blog post</a> by Mike\nBostock helped greatly understand what was actually going on and\nwhat I had to select at which times. I feel much, much more\ncomfortable in these paradigms now that I have finished this\nproject.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>d3.geo and d3.inertia</strong> were two of the completely new tools to\nthis project, but tools that I hope to use for many tools in the\nfuture. d3.geo refers to the set of digital cartography tools in d3,\nwhich translate geographic coordinates to pixels on the screen.\nLearning how to choose the right projection, format my data\ncorrectly, and create a smooth auto-rotation took a few more minutes\nthat I would have liked, but they worked eventually. d3.inertia\ntakes these features further by allowing the user to drag the globe\nand adding &quot;inertia&quot; when the user releases the mouse, to prevent\nthe globe rotation to come to a stop smoothly. This was actually\nquite annoying to work with because the localhost or 127.0.0.1\nserver on my computer did not produce a smooth drag, but this issue\nseems fixed now that I have pushed everything onto its own website.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Jargon, post-Marxist critical theory, and the analytics of\nraciality.</strong> The third &quot;coding&quot; challenge was a decoding challenge--\nworking through literature that was much more abstract than I was\nused to and trying to apply it to the data I had. Thank you to Erich\nKessel (TF for the seminar this project was completed in) for\nhelping with readings and understanding new text!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the very beginning of a project involving unfamiliar code, I find\nmyself constantly referencing StackOverflow answers, copy and pasting\ncode that looks useful, and debugging. As I learn more about how the\ncode/language/library works, I feel more comfortable writing the code\nmyself and eventually look to online resources to fix existing code\ninstead of provide code from scratch. When I began the map of Korean\nmusicians, I was clueless about d3 and even what the DOM was, and had\nto look up code for every single part of the project; now that I have\nfinished this project, I feel that I&#39;ve grasped the essential tools of\nd3 that allow many different projects to be built without constant use\nof a reference tool.</p>\n"}
