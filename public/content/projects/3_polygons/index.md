This\nhas some aesthetic appeal and interesting stories around land\nownership that I&#39;ve tried to bring out through selective\nhighlighting, for instance showing that the largest property in\nNew Haven is the Yale Golf Course.</p>\n<p><img src=\"3_polygons/buildings.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This stretches a bit beyond the traditional definitions of a\n&quot;map,&quot; though. A map is usually useful for adding context to\ngeographic features of interest, but this map does the complete\nopposite by removing physical objects from any sort of context\nand even making all but a select few unrecognizable.</p>\n<p>This was also a bit of a puzzle to code in R. I used the <code>sf</code>\npackage in R to manipulate the building geometries from their\noriginal locations into a grid setup, using lag functions to\nadjust their x- and y-coordinates based on the previous\nbuilding that was placed. This requires some tweaking -- you\nmight notice that some buildings overlap -- but it&#39;s good\nenough for one day&#39;s work.</p>\n"}
