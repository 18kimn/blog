{"data":{"title":"'Map' of New Haven properties by size","date":"2021-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"buildings.png"},"content":"<p>This is a &quot;map&quot; of New Haven properties sorted by size. This has some\naesthetic appeal and interesting stories around land ownership that\nI&#39;ve tried to bring out through selective highlighting, for instance\nshowing that the largest property in New Haven is the Yale Golf\nCourse.</p>\n<p><img src=\"3_polygons/buildings.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This stretches a bit beyond the traditional definitions of a &quot;map,&quot;\nthough. A map is usually useful for adding context to geographic\nfeatures of interest, but this map does the complete opposite by\nremoving physical objects from any sort of context and even making all\nbut a select few unrecognizable.</p>\n<p>This was also a bit of a puzzle to code in R. I used the <code>sf</code> package\nin R to manipulate the building geometries from their original\nlocations into a grid setup, using lag functions to adjust their x-\nand y-coordinates based on the previous building that was placed. This\nrequires some tweaking -- you might notice that some buildings overlap\n-- but it&#39;s good enough for one day&#39;s work.</p>\n"}
