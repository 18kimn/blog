{"data":{"title":"About this site","date":"2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"preview.png"},"content":"<h1 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h1>\n<p>Earlier in 2021, I was interested in data visualization, especially\ninteractive viz projects for the web. I first started this in R with\nthe <code>r2d3</code> package and deploying this in the Shiny framework, but I\nquickly realized this wouldn&#39;t be sustainable. I was working with a\nsubset of resources that made things clunkier, often leading to\nfrustrating roadblocks and compromises on things I wanted to make. I\ncould be more creative and learn more if I worked in JavaScript, since\nit handles HTML manipulation and browser rendering almost natively.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve learned a lot since then. I&#39;m glad to have had many opportunities\nto work on cool projects this year with organizations I work with and\nto have had the time to do projects of my own as well. So this site is\nsort of a culmination of all of that -- the actual things I&#39;ve worked\non, design thinking through the presentation of my website, and\nreflections to tie it all together.</p>\n<h1 id=\"technical-things\">Technical things</h1>\n<p>This website is built through <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a>, a\nweb development framework in turn built on the very popular React\nframework. Gatsby offers the advantage of server-side static site\nrendering, which means that users could experience faster load times\nthan client-rendered sites, but I just chose it because it was\nrecommended by the official React team. :)</p>\n<p>Animations on this site are created mostly with\n<a href=\"https://d3js.org/\">d3.js</a>, with the card transition on the home page\ndone through <a href=\"https://react-spring.io/\">React Spring</a>. I initially\nwanted to handle most animations in React Spring, as it seemed a\n&quot;better&quot; solution in being built specifically for React, but the API\nwas a little too inflexible for me. I also had a bit more experience\nwith d3 so I used it after creating the home page card transition.</p>\n<p>Styling and layouts are handled through the\n<a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">Material UI</a> framework, which is in turn\nbuilt on the Material Design system (elaborated a bit below).</p>\n<p>The source code for the website can be found at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/18kimn/blog\">https://github.com/18kimn/blog</a>. The\nblog is deployed from this link with\n<a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"design-things\">Design things</h1>\n<p>I know very little about design; I&#39;m learning a bit about both\nprinciples and practical considerations through creating this website.</p>\n<p>In a word, this site is designed around the concept of <em>paper</em>. This\ncombines Material Design&#39;s\n<a href=\"https://material.io/design/environment/surfaces.html#material-environment\">concept of Material surfaces</a>\nand <a href=\"https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/\">Ethan Schoonover&#39;s</a> idea\nof contrast in natural light. I tried to bring these together in this\nwebsite. I paired white modern-looking material surfaces with the\nyellowed background of Schoonover&#39;s Solarized color palette, because\nboth represent paper in different contexts. For many headings, I use a\n&quot;light&quot; font weight of 300 and a low opacity for line strokes on the\nbackground animation to mimic pencils on paper. Also in the background\nof the site, blurred circles track the mouse like watercolor on a\ncanvas.</p>\n<p>Trying to use that idea of paper takes me away from both Material\nDesign and Schoonover a bit. Schoonover&#39;s idea of low contrast to\nreflect natural light goes too far in my opinion, because a decent\namount of contrast is needed to read easily. I use his Solarized color\npalette in many different cases, but I often look for higher-contrast\nversions or tweak the palette if I can. The only surface of this\nwebsite where text appears is white, not the classic yellowish hue of\nSolarized. And Material Design in general has stricter principles than\napply for this website. For instance, shapes in the Material system\nare one component of UI, and Material therefore doesn&#39;t recommend a\nblur or transparency on shapes because they detract from functional\nuse. This contrasts with my more liberal use of shapes in the\nbackground animation on the site, where lines are animated and circles\nheavily blurred in order to make them interesting without making them\ndistracting.</p>\n<p>I chose this concept mostly because I thought it could be cool, but I\nalso wanted a design concept that reflects who I am. The faded\nbackground almost has the aesthetic of a historical document, which is\na backdrop to the modern-looking surface on top. This parallels my\ninterest in history and web development together.</p>\n<h1 id=\"content\">Content</h1>\n<p>This website doesn&#39;t have a lot of things right now. I&#39;m okay at\nstarting projects, not so great at finishing them :&#39;) you can look in\nthe <a href=\"/projects\">Projects</a> page if you want to see things I&#39;ve made so\nfar.</p>\n"}
