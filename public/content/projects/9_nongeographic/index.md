A preview is shown in the image below, and\nthe full interactive map can be found at\n<a href=\"https://korean-music-map.info\">korean-music-map.info</a>. All of the\ncode I used to create this can be found at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/18kimn/spotify_features\">github.com/18kimn/spotify_features</a>.\nIf you&#39;re interested in this project and want to talk more, you can\nemail me (nathan [dot] kim [at] yale [dot] edu) or we can talk on\nTwitter (@nathanckim).</p>\n<p>This map is a non-geographic map of Korean musicians. I scraped the\ndicography of every Korean artist on Spotify through their Web\nAPI[^1], then spent a while learning the D3 library in JavaScript to\nbuild an interactive plot that is somewhere between a network diagram,\na scatter plot, and a map.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://korean-music-map.info//\" width=\"90%\" height={800} style={{border: 0}}></iframe>\n  <br />\n  <a href=\"https://korean-music-map.info\"> To view the full visualization, click here.</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"basic-info\">Basic info</h2>\n<p>Each circle represents one artist, and color represents the main genre\nthat Spotify lists this artist under (blue means K-indie, orange means\nK-hiphop, green means K-pop, and red means Korean r&amp;b). The size of\neach circle represents popularity, which I adjusted to show more\ncontrast between bigger and smaller artists, and standardized across\ngenres so that K-pop (the most popular genre by far) wouldn&#39;t make\nartists in other genres appear much smaller. Zoom in and out by\nscrolling with your mouse. Clicking any circle reveals some basic\ninformation about the artist and reveals lines between them and other\nartists, which represent collaborations through music. Artists that\nare closer together on the visualization are closer together in\nmusical &quot;space&quot; by making music together or by having many mutual\ncollaborators between them.</p>\n<p>The outer set of circles are artists with few or no connections, such\nthat they aren&#39;t embedded within the chaotic space in the center. A\nfew really well-known music groups like TxT and BlackPink are in this\nouter ring; they mostly collab with non-Korean musicians or perform by\nthemselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-thoughts-on-the-map\">Some thoughts on the map</h2>\n<h4 id=\"motivations\">Motivations</h4>\n<p>As I stated\n<a href=\"https://nathankim.name/projects/map_month/7_newtool/\">before</a>, I&#39;ve\nbecome a huge fan of Korean music over the past few months, especially\nKorean R&amp;B, Korean hip-hop, and Korean indie. There&#39;s something super\nexciting about seeing artistic expression of any kind, and especially\nif artists try new genres or push on societal standards. Korean music\nhas come a long way in the past twenty or even past ten years, with\none result being a huge growth in diversity of genre.</p>\n<p>This map is an attempt to represent that diversity in Korean music. As\nmuch as I am a fan of BTS and BigBang, I often feel that pop musicians\nunder large companies are able to succeed internationally because of\ngiant marketing campaigns, connections made to other media sectors\nlike advertisements and TV shows, and of course years of training made\nby the investment of their company. Again, this is in no way a\ncriticism of successful pop groups and idols, many of whom I listen to\non a daily basis. I only wanted to show that Korean music is so much\nmore diverse than what the forces of capital might have us believe.</p>\n<p>The other inspiration for this map was from working through Spotify&#39;s\nrecommendations. I realized after a few months that as &quot;smart&quot; and\nsurprisingly insightful Spotify&#39;s algorithms might be, the way\nrecommendations are made kind of separates the song from the artist\nand prevents exploration of artists as <em>people</em> -- people with\nprofessional connections and intimate friendships with other artists,\npeople whose music change over time, people who spend time and thought\nto the order of songs on their album. In the Spotify app, you can&#39;t\nsearch for featurings an artist did, or find how their listenership\nchanged over time; songs are packaged in vibe- and genre-specific\nplaylists that are useful but limited. I made this map partly to\nemphasize this paradigm of artists as people, and in turn of music as\na dynamic social space with movement, attraction, repulsion, and\nconnections.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h4>\n<p>A major takeaway that I had after creating this map was that hip-hop\nmusicians have the most amount of collaborations by far, and pop\nmusicians have the least amount of collaborations by far. Here&#39;s a\nsimple bar graph I made from the data I was working with to show this;\nnearly all of the top 15 collaborators in Korean music are from Korean\nhip-hop. This makes sense, there&#39;s lots of famous collaborations in\nAmerican hip-hop too, and in Korean hip-hop some of the most famous\ntracks are mega-collaborations like\n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6Y0VCyjVZ7waMVgDMJffu4?si=nr1eegHCRgeAH4vfVeOgpA\">119 Remix</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6Mf7T0kJOuxTop2AE9L0Sc?si=6K-B7-LVShefHn8wfGeISA\">Code Clear</a>.\nHip-hop musicians also tend to stay hyper-active in music longer than\nKorean pop musicians (many of the artists in the plot below are in\ntheir mid-30s).</p>\n<p><img src=\"most_songs.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The second, more abstract takeaway I had while creating this map was\nthat while there is no way to represent space (or any concept)\ncompletely or &quot;accurately,&quot; it&#39;s still very useful to try. To make a\n&quot;map&quot;, I felt that I needed to represent space; I had no idea how to\ndo so given that longitude/latitude coordinates aren&#39;t part of\nSpotify&#39;s data. I instead used force simulations from the D3 library\nin JS, visually representing social connections as spatial ones via\ndistance and lines. Although horizontal and vertical scales don&#39;t mean\nanything specific on this map as a result, to me this map still\nrepresents space -- a complex set of interactions together, where\nconcepts of &quot;near&quot; and &quot;far&quot; can be seen, where movement can be\nunderstood.</p>\n<h4 id=\"about-coding\">About coding</h4>\n<p>This was my first time touching D3, and my extent of working with HTML\nand CSS was limited to styling R-based Shiny applets.[^2] I learned so\nmuch at every step, and every step was at least mildly frustrating.\nHere are a few highlights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/\">The data-join and selection paradigms.</a></strong>\nI love the ggplot2 ecosytem for data visualizations in R for many\nreasons; one of the biggest is that there is a coherent logic to\nguide it all. If you don&#39;t know how to make a type of chart,\nthere&#39;s no need to worry, because the process to create it is\nexactly like pretty much every other type of chart with one change.\nThere are parts you can name (grobs, geoms, themes) that might take\nsome time to get used to, but ultimately they help simplify code\nand save time. When I began making this map, I immediately looked\nfor the same logic in D3, but this was much more difficult because\nconcepts in D3 were just less intuitive and because they depend on\nideas familiar to web developers but unfamiliar to me (the DOM, how\nJSON data is structured). The data-join and selection paradigms are\nsome of these concepts that I still have difficulty understanding\nand I will probably have to relearn at some point in the future,\nbut I am glad overall to have grasped enough to build this map.</li>\n<li><strong>Styling</strong>. D3 has lots of pre-built structure that help make\nbeautiful graphics (color scales, force functions for movement,\ntransitions), but styling still represented a challenge for me in\nthis project. Setting fonts, making some text clickable,\npositioning the title in the right spot, making two columns and\nfour rows for the node tooltip, and so on all took me a few hours\non and off to make right.</li>\n<li><strong>Line positions</strong>. I solved an SAT-esque geometry question to stop\nlines from appearing inside of the circles, which I had found\naesthetically unpleasant. It went a little bit like:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two circles A and B with centers at coordinates (5,3) and\n(1,0) respectively and radii 3 and 1 respectively. Imagine a line\nsegment connecting the two centers. It passes through the edge of\nthe circles exactly once for each circle. What are the coordinates\nof where this line meets the circles&#39; edges?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My math skills are a bit rusty, but I eventually got this to work.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Scopes</strong>. I mainly work in R, where the scopes of environments\nare pretty easy to work with. You make an object once, you can\nrefer to it later in pretty much any context. Unless you&#39;re a\ndeveloper in R, you probably don&#39;t have to worry about scopes, and\neven if you are, paradigms like <code>tidyeval</code> have been created to\nmake these processes easy. But this concept became more difficult\nin JS given that <em>everything</em> was inside of a function -- because\ndata is loaded asynchronously, it has to be loaded inside a\nspecific <code>d3.json(function(data){...})</code> style call, and data can&#39;t\nbe referred to outside of this environment. I learned how to make\ndummy variables in global environments and update them in specific\nfunctions to work around scope issues.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"limitations-of-the-map\">Limitations of the map</h2>\n<p>There are lots of things &quot;wrong&quot; about this plot, some of which will\nbe improved in future iterations and others which I don&#39;t think I can\nimprove by myself. Firstly, to improve performance I cut the amount of\nlines that would show on the map, which meant only representing each\nartists&#39; top three collaborations. If an artist has more than three\nlines connecting to them, it means that work they are listed on were\nin <em>other</em> artists&#39; top three collaborations. If an artist has less\nthan two lines connecting to them, they either collborated with\nnon-Korean musicians, Korean musicians that Spotify did not have data\nfor, or did not collaborate with other musicians at all. The\nperformance issue that led to this data limitation is something I hope\nto improve in future iterations of the map, perhaps after I gain more\nexperience working with D3.</p>\n<p>Secondly, because Spotify only released in South Korea\n<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-01/spotify-launches-in-south-korea/\">this month</a>,\nthe perspective shown here is an outsider&#39;s view that obscures as much\nas it shows. Jay Park and artists under his label H1GHR music (for\nexample) might be inflated in node size compared to if listenership\ndata from Korea were able to be incorporated, given their\ndisproportionate popularity with international audiences. Even in a\nfew months, when data from Korea is able to be accessed through the\nSpotify API, listenership will probably not be represented well given\nthe Korean market is already saturated with other music streaming\nservices like Genie and Melon, and some very popular Korean artists\nwon&#39;t be hosted on Spotify Korea\n(<a href=\"https://hypebae.com/2021/2/spotify-korea-launch-without-iu-zico-monsta-x-kakao-m-k-pop-music-streaming-service-info\">IU</a>\nis one example).</p>\n<p>Thirdly, Spotify as a data source was incomplete in how it tracked\nartists&#39; information. Producer credits, older artists, and label or\ncompany information were all missing from the Spotify API. Artists of\ncourse also publish music on Soundcloud (and in Korea, Genie and Melon\nas mentioned before), perform music once at a club and never give a\nfull release, and so on -- Spotify is vastly incomplete.</p>\n<p>In the future, I&#39;ll revisit this project to update the data, work on\nperformance enhancements, and add more features. For now, I think I\nhave to do my reading responses and prepare for class.</p>\n<p>[^1]: and some modifications to the <code>spotifyr</code> package in R\n[^2]: If that means nothing to you, don&#39;t worry about it.</p>\n"}
