A preview is shown\nin the image below, and the full interactive map can be found\nat <a target='_blank'  href=\"https://korean-music-map.info\">korean-music-map.info</a>.

I scraped\nthe dicography of every Korean artist on Spotify through their\nWeb API[^1], then spent a while learning the D3 library in\nJavaScript to build an interactive plot that is somewhere\nbetween a network diagram, a scatter plot, and a map.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://korean-music-map.info//\" width=\"90%\" height={800} style={{border: 0}}></iframe>\n  <br />\n  <a href=\"https://korean-music-map.info\"> To view the full visualization, click here.</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading\" id=\"basic-info\">Basic info<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#basic-info\">#</a></h2><p>Each circle represents one artist, and color represents the\nmain genre that Spotify lists this artist under (blue means\nK-indie, orange means K-hiphop, green means K-pop, and red\nmeans Korean r&amp;b). The size of each circle represents\npopularity, which I adjusted to show more contrast between\nbigger and smaller artists, and standardized across genres so\nthat K-pop (the most popular genre by far) wouldn&#39;t make\nartists in other genres appear much smaller. Zoom in and out by\nscrolling with your mouse. Clicking any circle reveals some\nbasic information about the artist and reveals lines between\nthem and other artists, which represent collaborations through\nmusic. Artists that are closer together on the visualization\nare closer together in musical &quot;space&quot; by making music together\nor by having many mutual collaborators between them.</p>\n<p>The outer set of circles are artists with few or no\nconnections, such that they aren&#39;t embedded within the chaotic\nspace in the center. A few really well-known music groups like\nTxT and BlackPink are in this outer ring; they mostly collab\nwith non-Korean musicians or perform by themselves.</p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\" id=\"some-thoughts-on-the-map\">Some thoughts on the map<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#some-thoughts-on-the-map\">#</a></h2><h4 class=\"heading\" id=\"motivations\">Motivations<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#motivations\">#</a></h4><p>As I stated\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://nathankim.name/projects/map_month/7_newtool/\">before</a>,\nI&#39;ve become a huge fan of Korean music over the past few\nmonths, especially Korean R&amp;B, Korean hip-hop, and Korean\nindie. There&#39;s something super exciting about seeing artistic\nexpression of any kind, and especially if artists try new\ngenres or push on societal standards. Korean music has come a\nlong way in the past twenty or even past ten years, with one\nresult being a huge growth in diversity of genre.</p>\n<p>This map is an attempt to represent that diversity in Korean\nmusic. As much as I am a fan of BTS and BigBang, I often feel\nthat pop musicians under large companies are able to succeed\ninternationally because of giant marketing campaigns,\nconnections made to other media sectors like advertisements and\nTV shows, and of course years of training made by the\ninvestment of their company. Again, this is in no way a\ncriticism of successful pop groups and idols, many of whom I\nlisten to on a daily basis. I only wanted to show that Korean\nmusic is so much more diverse than what the forces of capital\nmight have us believe.</p>\n<p>The other inspiration for this map was from working through\nSpotify&#39;s recommendations. I realized after a few months that\nas &quot;smart&quot; and surprisingly insightful Spotify&#39;s algorithms\nmight be, the way recommendations are made kind of separates\nthe song from the artist and prevents exploration of artists as\n<em>people</em> -- people with professional connections and intimate\nfriendships with other artists, people whose music change over\ntime, people who spend time and thought to the order of songs\non their album. In the Spotify app, you can&#39;t search for\nfeaturings an artist did, or find how their listenership\nchanged over time; songs are packaged in vibe- and\ngenre-specific playlists that are useful but limited. I made\nthis map partly to emphasize this paradigm of artists as\npeople, and in turn of music as a dynamic social space with\nmovement, attraction, repulsion, and connections.</p>\n<h4 class=\"heading\" id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#what-i-learned\">#</a></h4><p>A major takeaway that I had after creating this map was that\nhip-hop musicians have the most amount of collaborations by\nfar, and pop musicians have the least amount of collaborations\nby far. Here&#39;s a simple bar graph I made from the data I was\nworking with to show this; nearly all of the top 15\ncollaborators in Korean music are from Korean hip-hop. This\nmakes sense, there&#39;s lots of famous collaborations in American\nhip-hop too, and in Korean hip-hop some of the most famous\ntracks are mega-collaborations like\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6Y0VCyjVZ7waMVgDMJffu4?si=nr1eegHCRgeAH4vfVeOgpA\">119 Remix</a>\nor\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6Mf7T0kJOuxTop2AE9L0Sc?si=6K-B7-LVShefHn8wfGeISA\">Code Clear</a>.\nHip-hop musicians also tend to stay hyper-active in music\nlonger than Korean pop musicians (many of the artists in the\nplot below are in their mid-30s).</p>\n<p><img src=\"9_nongeographic/most_songs.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The second, more abstract takeaway I had while creating this\nmap was that while there is no way to represent space (or any\nconcept) completely or &quot;accurately,&quot; it&#39;s still very useful to\ntry. To make a &quot;map&quot;, I felt that I needed to represent space;\nI had no idea how to do so given that longitude/latitude\ncoordinates aren&#39;t part of Spotify&#39;s data. I instead used force\nsimulations from the D3 library in JS, visually representing\nsocial connections as spatial ones via distance and lines.\nAlthough horizontal and vertical scales don&#39;t mean anything\nspecific on this map as a result, to me this map still\nrepresents space -- a complex set of interactions together,\nwhere concepts of &quot;near&quot; and &quot;far&quot; can be seen, where movement\ncan be understood.</p>\n<h4 class=\"heading\" id=\"about-coding\">About coding<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#about-coding\">#</a></h4><p>This was my first time touching D3, and my extent of working\nwith HTML and CSS was limited to styling R-based Shiny\napplets.[^2] I learned so much at every step, and every step\nwas at least mildly frustrating. Here are a few highlights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a target='_blank'  href=\"https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/\">The data-join and selection paradigms.</a></strong>\nI love the ggplot2 ecosytem for data visualizations in R for\nmany reasons; one of the biggest is that there is a coherent\nlogic to guide it all. If you don&#39;t know how to make a type\nof chart, there&#39;s no need to worry, because the process to\ncreate it is exactly like pretty much every other type of\nchart with one change. There are parts you can name (grobs,\ngeoms, themes) that might take some time to get used to, but\nultimately they help simplify code and save time. When I\nbegan making this map, I immediately looked for the same\nlogic in D3, but this was much more difficult because\nconcepts in D3 were just less intuitive and because they\ndepend on ideas familiar to web developers but unfamiliar to\nme (the DOM, how JSON data is structured). The data-join and\nselection paradigms are some of these concepts that I still\nhave difficulty understanding and I will probably have to\nrelearn at some point in the future, but I am glad overall\nto have grasped enough to build this map.</li>\n<li><strong>Styling</strong>. D3 has lots of pre-built structure that help\nmake beautiful graphics (color scales, force functions for\nmovement, transitions), but styling still represented a\nchallenge for me in this project. Setting fonts, making some\ntext clickable, positioning the title in the right spot,\nmaking two columns and four rows for the node tooltip, and\nso on all took me a few hours on and off to make right.</li>\n<li><strong>Line positions</strong>. I solved an SAT-esque geometry question\nto stop lines from appearing inside of the circles, which I\nhad found aesthetically unpleasant. It went a little bit\nlike:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two circles A and B with centers at coordinates\n(5,3) and (1,0) respectively and radii 3 and 1 respectively.\nImagine a line segment connecting the two centers. It passes\nthrough the edge of the circles exactly once for each circle.\nWhat are the coordinates of where this line meets the\ncircles&#39; edges?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My math skills are a bit rusty, but I eventually got this to\nwork.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Scopes</strong>. I mainly work in R, where the scopes of\nenvironments are pretty easy to work with. You make an\nobject once, you can refer to it later in pretty much any\ncontext. Unless you&#39;re a developer in R, you probably don&#39;t\nhave to worry about scopes, and even if you are, paradigms\nlike <code>tidyeval</code> have been created to make these processes\neasy. But this concept became more difficult in JS given\nthat <em>everything</em> was inside of a function -- because data\nis loaded asynchronously, it has to be loaded inside a\nspecific <code>d3.json(function(data){...})</code> style call, and data\ncan&#39;t be referred to outside of this environment. I learned\nhow to make dummy variables in global environments and\nupdate them in specific functions to work around scope\nissues.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"heading\" id=\"limitations-of-the-map\">Limitations of the map<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#limitations-of-the-map\">#</a></h2><p>There are lots of things &quot;wrong&quot; about this plot, some of which\nwill be improved in future iterations and others which I don&#39;t\nthink I can improve by myself. Firstly, to improve performance\nI cut the amount of lines that would show on the map, which\nmeant only representing each artists&#39; top three collaborations.\nIf an artist has more than three lines connecting to them, it\nmeans that work they are listed on were in <em>other</em> artists&#39; top\nthree collaborations. If an artist has less than two lines\nconnecting to them, they either collborated with non-Korean\nmusicians, Korean musicians that Spotify did not have data for,\nor did not collaborate with other musicians at all. The\nperformance issue that led to this data limitation is something\nI hope to improve in future iterations of the map, perhaps\nafter I gain more experience working with D3.</p>\n<p>Secondly, because Spotify only released in South Korea\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-01/spotify-launches-in-south-korea/\">this month</a>,\nthe perspective shown here is an outsider&#39;s view that obscures\nas much as it shows. Jay Park and artists under his label H1GHR\nmusic (for example) might be inflated in node size compared to\nif listenership data from Korea were able to be incorporated,\ngiven their disproportionate popularity with international\naudiences. Even in a few months, when data from Korea is able\nto be accessed through the Spotify API, listenership will\nprobably not be represented well given the Korean market is\nalready saturated with other music streaming services like\nGenie and Melon, and some very popular Korean artists won&#39;t be\nhosted on Spotify Korea\n(<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://hypebae.com/2021/2/spotify-korea-launch-without-iu-zico-monsta-x-kakao-m-k-pop-music-streaming-service-info\">IU</a>\nis one example).</p>\n<p>Thirdly, Spotify as a data source was incomplete in how it\ntracked artists&#39; information. Producer credits, older artists,\nand label or company information were all missing from the\nSpotify API. Artists of course also publish music on Soundcloud\n(and in Korea, Genie and Melon as mentioned before), perform\nmusic once at a club and never give a full release, and so on\n-- Spotify is vastly incomplete.</p>\n<p>In the future, I&#39;ll revisit this project to update the data,\nwork on performance enhancements, and add more features. For\nnow, I think I have to do my reading responses and prepare for\nclass.</p>\n<p>[^1]: and some modifications to the <code>spotifyr</code> package in R\n[^2]: If that means nothing to you, don&#39;t worry about it.</p>\n"}
