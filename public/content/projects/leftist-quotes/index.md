Two basic those things I\nlearned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>backend architecture: how do we set up GET requests? Where\ndoes this deploy?</li>\n<li>Web architecture in general: what are DNS requests and\nforwarding?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point was especially confusing and tedious, as I had\nto reroute <a target='_blank'  href=\"https://leftist-quotes.com\">https://leftist-quotes.com</a>, <a target='_blank'  href=\"http://www.leftist-quotes.com\">www.leftist-quotes.com</a>,\nand so on all to the same root site.</p>\n<p>The other thing I realized while scraping the marxists.org\nwebpage was that the marxists.org website was built in the\nstone ages. Every single quote was placed inside of a\n<code>document.write(&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;)</code> statement, and the entire page was\nessentially a single <code>switch</code> statement that was nearly eight\nhundred clauses long. On one hand, that must have taken a\nridiculously long time to make since every quote had to be\nmanually coded and formatted. On the other hand, it&#39;s not\nperformant as the page has to load a few megabytes more than it\nneeds and anyone editing it in the future would probably be\nextremely frustrated.</p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\" id=\"next-steps\">Next steps<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#next-steps\">#</a></h2><p>I hope to add more quotes eventually and tag the API with the\nsource I got these from. Marxists.org is great, but there&#39;s a\nlittle too much Hegel and Trotsky in on their source for my\ntaste. <a target='_blank'  href=\"https://twitter.com/rwgilmoregirls\">@rwgilmoregirls</a> on\nTwitter and <a target='_blank'  href=\"https://redfish.media/\">redfish media</a> always\ntweet great things, so grabbing the alt text on those tweets\ncould be one option.</p>\n"}
