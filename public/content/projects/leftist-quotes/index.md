It&#39;s incredibly\nsimple, so I just threw everything in the root directory instead of\ncreating src/ or static/ folders and so on.</p>\n<p>This is my first API that I&#39;ve built, which was exciting and\ndefinitely a learning experience. Two basic those things I learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>backend architecture: how do we set up GET requests? Where does this\ndeploy?</li>\n<li>Web architecture in general: what are DNS requests and forwarding?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point was especially confusing and tedious, as I had to\nreroute <a href=\"https://leftist-quotes.com\">https://leftist-quotes.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.leftist-quotes.com\">www.leftist-quotes.com</a>, and so on\nall to the same root site.</p>\n<p>The other thing I realized while scraping the marxists.org webpage was\nthat the marxists.org website was built in the stone ages. Every\nsingle quote was placed inside of a <code>document.write(&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;)</code>\nstatement, and the entire page was essentially a single <code>switch</code>\nstatement that was nearly eight hundred clauses long. On one hand,\nthat must have taken a ridiculously long time to make since every\nquote had to be manually coded and formatted. On the other hand, it&#39;s\nnot performant as the page has to load a few megabytes more than it\nneeds and anyone editing it in the future would probably be extremely\nfrustrated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>I hope to add more quotes eventually and tag the API with the source I\ngot these from. Marxists.org is great, but there&#39;s a little too much\nHegel and Trotsky in on their source for my taste.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rwgilmoregirls\">@rwgilmoregirls</a> on Twitter and\n<a href=\"https://redfish.media/\">redfish media</a> always tweet great things, so\ngrabbing the alt text on those tweets could be one option.</p>\n"}
