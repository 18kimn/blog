{"data":{"title":"NULL: Prison gerrymandering and migration","date":"2021-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"assembled.png"},"content":"<p>This past winter break, I made a few maps inspired by the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge\">30 day map challenge</a>.\nThis is one of them, responding to the prompt of &quot;NULL.&quot; The maps in\nresponse to the challenge aren&#39;t too polished or meaningful, but they\nwere a fun chance to quickly create things and try to learn some new\ntechnical skills.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s another map that took a few days to make and is still\nunfinished as it is. For the theme of <code>NULL</code>, I created a map to\nrepresents prison gerrymandering, or the practice of counting\nincarcerated individuals in their location of imprisonment rather than\nin their home communities for the Census and for legislative\nredistricting. With prison gerrymandering, population and political\npower are artificially inflated in an exo-cartographic manuever:\nwithout drawing any new lines on a map, districts of imprisonment gain\nrepresentative power and districts hit most heavily by the pandemic of\nmass incarceration lose representative power.</p>\n<p>The theme of <code>NULL</code> in the Month of Maps series fits this pattern\nwell. Some individuals are effectively erased from the hegemonic\nsphere of political influence (prisoners in nearly every state lose\ntheir right to vote), creating a void or a <code>NULL</code> space.</p>\n<p>My response was an animated cartogram that shows some congressional\ndistricts increasing in size due to this usurpation of political power\nand others decreasing or disappearing as a result.</p>\n<img src= \"assembled.gif\" alt=\"GIF of prison gerrymandering and migration.\" style=\"width: 70%; position: relative; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, 0)\"/>\n\n<p>This was challenging to make on two fronts. Firstly, there is no\nauthoritative source for the net increases and decreases due to\npopulation migration, and thus the data represented here is\nproblematic for several reasons. I used the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends\">Vera Institute&#39;s Incarceration Trends</a>\ndataset for the home counties of those imprisoned as well as the\n<a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/\">Prison Policy Initiative&#39;s Data Toolbox</a>\nto find the group quarters population of each block that contains a\nprison. I then used a point-to-polygon spatial join to merge prisons\nonto counties, then summarized everything to the county level for\nwhere there were two or more prisons per county. The next step was to\ncreate intersections between counties and legislative districts, after\nwhich I used the area of each county that had been split to divide a\ncounty&#39;s population statistics into different legislative districts\n(Los Angeles County is one example of such a county that resides in\nmultiple congressional districts). I added all of these together by\ncongressional district to create a congressional-district-level\nprofile. Finally, I calculated &quot;population change due to prisons&quot; as\nthe difference between the population of a congressional district due\nto prisons and the population of the congressional district who had\nbeen imprisoned. If more of the population in a district came from a\nprison as had been sent to a prison, the town effectively experienced\nan increase in population due to a local prison. If more of the\npopulation in a district had been sent to a prison than had come from\na prison, this is an indicator of population shrinkage.</p>\n<p>This method &quot;works&quot; as in it returns a dataset of net population\nchanges due to prisons in the area, but it is frustrating and\nincomplete for many reasons and I hope that this GIF is only seen as a\nlearning student&#39;s work-in-progress and not a definitive visualization\nof prison gerrymandering in the United States. Firstly, the cobbling\ntogether of various sources added more uncertainty and &quot;inaccuracy&quot; at\nevery step. The Vera Institute&#39;s data in particular was incomplete, as\n563 counties in 2010 were missing incarceration data. The\npolygon-to-polygon spatial join from counties onto legislative\ndistricts is also methodologically questionable; In weighting by area\nfor the spatial join, I made the assumption that a county&#39;s prison\nincarceration profile was equally distributed across the county, but\nthis assumption is inaccurate and especially misleading in counties\nthat encompass cities.</p>\n<p>The second front I was challenged on were the technical and aesthetic\nproblems in creating the visualization. I had never made a cartogram\nbefore, and my home language of R proved a bit tedious and unwieldy\nfor doing so.[^1] The only guides I could find along for the task in R\nwere a bit outdated and didn&#39;t use the <code>sf</code> grammar of spatial data in\nR that has emerged as the cleanest and most sensible paradigm for\nmanipulating geometries. Perhaps due to my inexperience and lack of\nforesight, I realized too late that the U.S. has several hundred too\nmany congressional districts to make for an attractive cartogram --\nalthough we see expansion and contraction, it&#39;s too crowded to\nhighlight strong trends in the data. Animating the graphic also proved\nto be challenging. The <code>transformr</code> package in R had recently been\nreleased to produce animation frames for spatial data, but bugs here\nprevented me from making a clean set of frames. I eventually had to\ndelete the problem state of Montana entirely as a workaround. I never\nfound out why Montana specifically kept returning errors, and if it\nwas an issue with how <code>cartogram</code> assembles <code>sf</code> objects or with how\n<code>transformr</code> manipulates them.</p>\n<p>Still, like all items in this series, making this graphic was a\nlearning process, and each problem illuminated just as much as it\nobfuscated. Some key takeaways for a better graphic:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Localize. Focus on a state with a substantial number of counties,\none with large enough population to have a meaningful trend of\nprison migration or gerrymandering. California or New York could\nwork.</li>\n<li>Use a medium like QGIS to create the cartogram, and return to R for\nthe task of animation. I trust QGIS as a well-developed medium made\nspecifically for cartography, whereas tools in R are often made as\na weekend project by an individual whose profession is only\ntangentially related to the field I intend to use the tool for.</li>\n<li>Merge prisons directly onto legislative districts instead of\nsummarizing onto the county-level first. This avoids part of the\ndistortion of statistics from the county-to-congressional-district\nmerge.</li>\n<li>Instead of weighting by area, use a spatial join to merge Census\nblock-level population data onto county-legislative intersections,\nthen weight by this population data instead of by area. In simpler\nterms, use people to weight, not land, because people aren&#39;t\ndistributed evenly across land.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully I can clean this up and upload a cleaner graphic when I have\nthe chance.</p>\n<p>[^1]:\n    Coming into the project, I had thought that R would be well-suited\n    for creating cartograms as a more\n    computational/statistical/technical/flexible medium than other\n    popular software like QGIS or ArcGIS. I&#39;ve realized that the\n    ecosystem of cartography in R isn&#39;t as developed as in other\n    software (even the <code>cartogram</code> package I used is no longer\n    maintained by its creator), and perhaps I was also mistaken that\n    GUI-based software wouldn&#39;t be flexible enough to manipulate\n    geometries.</p>\n"}
