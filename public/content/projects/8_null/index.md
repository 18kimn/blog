{"data":{"title":"NULL: Prison gerrymandering and migration","date":"2021-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"assembled.png"},"toc":[],"content":"<p>This past winter break, I made a few maps inspired by the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge\">30 day map challenge</a>.\nThis is one of them, responding to the prompt of &quot;NULL.&quot; The\nmaps in response to the challenge aren&#39;t too polished or\nmeaningful, but they were a fun chance to quickly create things\nand try to learn some new technical skills.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s another map that took a few days to make and is still\nunfinished as it is. For the theme of <code>NULL</code>, I created a map\nto represents prison gerrymandering, or the practice of\ncounting incarcerated individuals in their location of\nimprisonment rather than in their home communities for the\nCensus and for legislative redistricting. With prison\ngerrymandering, population and political power are artificially\ninflated in an exo-cartographic manuever: without drawing any\nnew lines on a map, districts of imprisonment gain\nrepresentative power and districts hit most heavily by the\npandemic of mass incarceration lose representative power.</p>\n<p>The theme of <code>NULL</code> in the Month of Maps series fits this\npattern well. Some individuals are effectively erased from the\nhegemonic sphere of political influence (prisoners in nearly\nevery state lose their right to vote), creating a void or a\n<code>NULL</code> space.</p>\n<p>My response was an animated cartogram that shows some\ncongressional districts increasing in size due to this\nusurpation of political power and others decreasing or\ndisappearing as a result.</p>\n<img src= \"assembled.gif\" alt=\"GIF of prison gerrymandering and migration.\" style=\"width: 70%; position: relative; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, 0)\"/>\n\n<p>This was challenging to make on two fronts. Firstly, there is\nno authoritative source for the net increases and decreases due\nto population migration, and thus the data represented here is\nproblematic for several reasons. I used the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends\">Vera Institute&#39;s Incarceration Trends</a>\ndataset for the home counties of those imprisoned as well as\nthe\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/\">Prison Policy Initiative&#39;s Data Toolbox</a>\nto find the group quarters population of each block that\ncontains a prison. I then used a point-to-polygon spatial join\nto merge prisons onto counties, then summarized everything to\nthe county level for where there were two or more prisons per\ncounty. The next step was to create intersections between\ncounties and legislative districts, after which I used the area\nof each county that had been split to divide a county&#39;s\npopulation statistics into different legislative districts (Los\nAngeles County is one example of such a county that resides in\nmultiple congressional districts). I added all of these\ntogether by congressional district to create a\ncongressional-district-level profile. Finally, I calculated\n&quot;population change due to prisons&quot; as the difference between\nthe population of a congressional district due to prisons and\nthe population of the congressional district who had been\nimprisoned. If more of the population in a district came from a\nprison as had been sent to a prison, the town effectively\nexperienced an increase in population due to a local prison. If\nmore of the population in a district had been sent to a prison\nthan had come from a prison, this is an indicator of population\nshrinkage.</p>\n<p>This method &quot;works&quot; as in it returns a dataset of net\npopulation changes due to prisons in the area, but it is\nfrustrating and incomplete for many reasons and I hope that\nthis GIF is only seen as a learning student&#39;s work-in-progress\nand not a definitive visualization of prison gerrymandering in\nthe United States. Firstly, the cobbling together of various\nsources added more uncertainty and &quot;inaccuracy&quot; at every step.\nThe Vera Institute&#39;s data in particular was incomplete, as 563\ncounties in 2010 were missing incarceration data. The\npolygon-to-polygon spatial join from counties onto legislative\ndistricts is also methodologically questionable; In weighting\nby area for the spatial join, I made the assumption that a\ncounty&#39;s prison incarceration profile was equally distributed\nacross the county, but this assumption is inaccurate and\nespecially misleading in counties that encompass cities.</p>\n<p>The second front I was challenged on were the technical and\naesthetic problems in creating the visualization. I had never\nmade a cartogram before, and my home language of R proved a bit\ntedious and unwieldy for doing so.[^1] The only guides I could\nfind along for the task in R were a bit outdated and didn&#39;t use\nthe <code>sf</code> grammar of spatial data in R that has emerged as the\ncleanest and most sensible paradigm for manipulating\ngeometries. Perhaps due to my inexperience and lack of\nforesight, I realized too late that the U.S. has several\nhundred too many congressional districts to make for an\nattractive cartogram -- although we see expansion and\ncontraction, it&#39;s too crowded to highlight strong trends in the\ndata. Animating the graphic also proved to be challenging. The\n<code>transformr</code> package in R had recently been released to produce\nanimation frames for spatial data, but bugs here prevented me\nfrom making a clean set of frames. I eventually had to delete\nthe problem state of Montana entirely as a workaround. I never\nfound out why Montana specifically kept returning errors, and\nif it was an issue with how <code>cartogram</code> assembles <code>sf</code> objects\nor with how <code>transformr</code> manipulates them.</p>\n<p>Still, like all items in this series, making this graphic was a\nlearning process, and each problem illuminated just as much as\nit obfuscated. Some key takeaways for a better graphic:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Localize. Focus on a state with a substantial number of\ncounties, one with large enough population to have a\nmeaningful trend of prison migration or gerrymandering.\nCalifornia or New York could work.</li>\n<li>Use a medium like QGIS to create the cartogram, and return\nto R for the task of animation. I trust QGIS as a\nwell-developed medium made specifically for cartography,\nwhereas tools in R are often made as a weekend project by an\nindividual whose profession is only tangentially related to\nthe field I intend to use the tool for.</li>\n<li>Merge prisons directly onto legislative districts instead of\nsummarizing onto the county-level first. This avoids part of\nthe distortion of statistics from the\ncounty-to-congressional-district merge.</li>\n<li>Instead of weighting by area, use a spatial join to merge\nCensus block-level population data onto county-legislative\nintersections, then weight by this population data instead\nof by area. In simpler terms, use people to weight, not\nland, because people aren&#39;t distributed evenly across land.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully I can clean this up and upload a cleaner graphic when\nI have the chance.</p>\n<p>[^1]:\n    Coming into the project, I had thought that R would be\n    well-suited for creating cartograms as a more\n    computational/statistical/technical/flexible medium than\n    other popular software like QGIS or ArcGIS. I&#39;ve realized\n    that the ecosystem of cartography in R isn&#39;t as developed\n    as in other software (even the <code>cartogram</code> package I used\n    is no longer maintained by its creator), and perhaps I was\n    also mistaken that GUI-based software wouldn&#39;t be flexible\n    enough to manipulate geometries.</p>\n"}
