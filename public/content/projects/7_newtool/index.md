{"data":{"title":"Map with a new tool: Seoul, songs, spaces","date":"2021-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"annotated.png"},"content":"<p>This past winter break, I made a few maps inspired by the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge\">30 day map challenge</a>.\nThis is one of them, responding to the prompt of &quot;map with a new\ntool.&quot; The maps in response to the challenge aren&#39;t too polished or\nmeaningful, but they were a fun chance to quickly create things and\ntry to learn some new technical skills.</p>\n<p>Over the past few months, I&#39;ve developed a strong interest in Korean\nhip-hop, R&amp;B, and Indie. I realized that a lot of these songs are\nwritten about specific places in Seoul, while the same cannot be said\nabout many other genres or locations (e.g. songs about New York\nneighborhoods are not as common). I collected a few here and laid them\nover a modified version of the Mapbox Japan theme. The new tool I used\nhere was Figma, a graphic design software that is surprisingly\nintuitive to use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"7_newtool/annotated.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This map is one that I think has a lot of potential, but still needs\nmore time and thought to clarify its ideas. Why do artists write songs\nabout Seoul or places in Seoul in the first place -- how is space\ngiven meaning before the song is written? What do the songs say about\nthese places, and what effect do they have on how the city as a whole\nis imagined? Diving into the songs&#39; lyrics, their genres, and the\nbiographies of these artists would lend a lot of insight into these\nquestions.
