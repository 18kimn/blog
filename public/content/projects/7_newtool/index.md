I realized that a lot of these\nsongs are written about specific places in Seoul, while the\nsame cannot be said about many other genres or locations (e.g.\nsongs about New York neighborhoods are not as common). I\ncollected a few here and laid them over a modified version of\nthe Mapbox Japan theme. The new tool I used here was Figma, a\ngraphic design software that is surprisingly intuitive to use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"7_newtool/annotated.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This map is one that I think has a lot of potential, but still\nneeds more time and thought to clarify its ideas. Why do\nartists write songs about Seoul or places in Seoul in the first\nplace -- how is space given meaning before the song is written?\nWhat do the songs say about these places, and what effect do\nthey have on how the city as a whole is imagined? Diving into\nthe songs&#39; lyrics, their genres, and the biographies of these\nartists would lend a lot of insight into these questions.\nPlease feel free to reach out if you&#39;d like to collaborate on a\nproject related to this.</p>\n<p>Please also feel free to reference the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7MuIDL8rxlgPpBDVcqGLu1?si=o47wM-AaTGqpbL13YTUDpg\">Spotify playlist</a>\nI made in the process.</p>\n"}
