In brief,\nthe land survey was one of the first projects Japan undertook\nafter it colonized Korea in 1910, documenting every single plot\nof land in Korea with its value, area, and ownership. The\nsurvey was the first unified documentation of land ownership\ncovering all of Korea, and was important to Japan for\nappropriating land from Korean peasantry as well as\nsystematically collecting land taxes and rent. The land survey\nwas also important in broader terms past economic use; it\nformed an epistemplogical &quot;backbone&quot; against which further\ndevelopment of all kinds was created, not just economic but\nalso cultural and political. The creation of some 800,000 maps\nas part of the survey formed a corpus for building development,\nsewer systems, parks and recreation centers, religious\ninstitutiohns, and other structures that were led by the\nJapanese Governor-General of Korea. These structures were\nessential for the Japanese project of assmilating Koreans and\neliciting cultural consent, which were especially important\ngoals after the March First Movement for Korean independence of\n1919, and labor strikes that occurred in the later years of\ncolonial rule.</p>\n<p><img src=\"6_grid/./assembled_stanford.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This map is a &quot;grid&quot; in two ways. Most obviously it&#39;s a grid in\nthat the picture is made of several rectangular panels\n(sixty-three in total). Although the Japanese land survey\npublished a huge number of maps that are still preserved by the\nNational Archives of Korea, I had a really tough time accessing\nthese records as I wasn&#39;t a Korean citizen and the digitization\nof these maps was often low-quality. Publicly accessible maps\nlike these are often shown on a case-by-case basis or one or\ntwo at a time instead of as a large catalog of searchable\nitems, which is interesting considering one of the hallmarks of\nthe survey was its almost overwhelming consistency and\nadherence to methods that make them perfectly suited for items\nin an API-esque query system. The tiles above all came from the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jr172wm5846\">Stanford University Library</a>,\nwhich is the most well-documented source for these maps that I\ncould find. I was able to dig through the website code a bit to\nfind how each map was hosted and in what dimensions, and then\nprogrammatically downloaded, cropped, and assembled these maps\nin R to produce the above graphic.</p>\n<p>The second &quot;grid&quot; aspect can be seen in how each individual\ntile was created. Cartography in Korea before 1900 definitely\nhas a strong and diverse history, but the history of these maps\nis nearly disjoint from the evolution of the &quot;scientific&quot; maps\nof the West -- Korean cartographers weren&#39;t intent on\nscientifically measuring and documenting land with a unified\nset of standards, and maps were artistic and cultural products\nrather than economic ones.<sup id=\"fn-1\"><a href=\"#note-1\">1</a></sup> After Japan began encroaching on the Korean\nPeninsula in 1876 and formally annexed the nation in 1910, this\nchanged -- the cartographic tradition in Korea was quickly\nwritten over by the Land Survey Bureau&#39;s maps that all relied\non the longitude-latitude grid. This process took time,\nmillions of yen, and tens of thousands of workers, but Japan\nsaw the need to represent Korea in the same coordinate system\nas itself in order to bring the colony into the empire. The\ngrid, however objective it might seem, thus served as a\ncolonizing force to standardize, unify, assimilate.</p>\n<p>For more info:</p>\n<p>Gragert, Edwin H. <em>Landownership under Colonial Rule: Korea&#39;s\nJapanese Experience, 1900-1935.</em> University of Hawaii\nPress, 1994.</p>\n<p><a target='_blank'  href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule#Japanese_migration_and_land_ownership\">Wiki article</a></p>\n<p><a target='_blank'  href=\"https://apjjf.org/2012/10/52/David-A.-Fedman/3876/article.html\">David Fedman&#39;s 2018 article on the subject</a></p>\n<hr/><ol><li id=\"note-1\">This doesn&#39;t mean that Korean maps\nweren&#39;t detailed -- Korean cartographer Kim Chon-Ho produced a\nseries of <em>extremely</em> detailed maps, most notably the\n<em>Territorial map of the Great East</em> that is still celebrated\ntoday.
