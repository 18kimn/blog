My incomplete\nresponse for the prompt of &quot;grid&quot; is a collage of Japanese land survey\nmaps of Korea published in 1910. In brief, the land survey was one of\nthe first projects Japan undertook after it colonized Korea in 1910,\ndocumenting every single plot of land in Korea with its value, area,\nand ownership. The survey was the first unified documentation of land\nownership covering all of Korea, and was important to Japan for\nappropriating land from Korean peasantry as well as systematically\ncollecting land taxes and rent. The land survey was also important in\nbroader terms past economic use; it formed an epistemplogical\n&quot;backbone&quot; against which further development of all kinds was created,\nnot just economic but also cultural and political. The creation of\nsome 800,000 maps as part of the survey formed a corpus for building\ndevelopment, sewer systems, parks and recreation centers, religious\ninstitutiohns, and other structures that were led by the Japanese\nGovernor-General of Korea. These structures were essential for the\nJapanese project of assmilating Koreans and eliciting cultural\nconsent, which were especially important goals after the March First\nMovement for Korean independence of 1919, and labor strikes that\noccurred in the later years of colonial rule.</p>\n<p><img src=\"6_grid/./assembled_stanford.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This map is a &quot;grid&quot; in two ways. Most obviously it&#39;s a grid in that\nthe picture is made of several rectangular panels (sixty-three in\ntotal). Although the Japanese land survey published a huge number of\nmaps that are still preserved by the National Archives of Korea, I had\na really tough time accessing these records as I wasn&#39;t a Korean\ncitizen and the digitization of these maps was often low-quality.\nPublicly accessible maps like these are often shown on a case-by-case\nbasis or one or two at a time instead of as a large catalog of\nsearchable items, which is interesting considering one of the\nhallmarks of the survey was its almost overwhelming consistency and\nadherence to methods that make them perfectly suited for items in an\nAPI-esque query system. The tiles above all came from the\n<a href=\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jr172wm5846\">Stanford University Library</a>,\nwhich is the most well-documented source for these maps that I could\nfind. I was able to dig through the website code a bit to find how\neach map was hosted and in what dimensions, and then programmatically\ndownloaded, cropped, and assembled these maps in R to produce the\nabove graphic.</p>\n<p>The second &quot;grid&quot; aspect can be seen in how each individual tile was\ncreated. Cartography in Korea before 1900 definitely has a strong and\ndiverse history, but the history of these maps is nearly disjoint from\nthe evolution of the &quot;scientific&quot; maps of the West -- Korean\ncartographers weren&#39;t intent on scientifically measuring and\ndocumenting land with a unified set of standards, and maps were\nartistic and cultural products rather than economic ones.^[This\ndoesn&#39;t mean that Korean maps weren&#39;t detailed -- Korean cartographer\nKim Chon-Ho produced a series of <em>extremely</em> detailed maps, most\nnotably the <em>Territorial map of the Great East</em> that is still\ncelebrated today. But the adherence to scientific standards and\nspecifically geometric accuracy wasn&#39;t as present in Korean\ncartographey, and thus Korean maps were incredibly diverse in shape\nand form.] After Japan began encroaching on the Korean Peninsula in\n1876 and formally annexed the nation in 1910, this changed -- the\ncartographic tradition in Korea was quickly written over by the Land\nSurvey Bureau&#39;s maps that all relied on the longitude-latitude grid.\nThis process took time, millions of yen, and tens of thousands of\nworkers, but Japan saw the need to represent Korea in the same\ncoordinate system as itself in order to bring the colony into the\nempire. The grid, however objective it might seem, thus served as a\ncolonizing force to standardize, unify, assimilate.</p>\n<p>For more info:</p>\n<p>Gragert, Edwin H. <em>Landownership under Colonial Rule: Korea&#39;s Japanese\nExperience, 1900-1935.</em> University of Hawaii Press, 1994.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule#Japanese_migration_and_land_ownership\">Wiki article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apjjf.org/2012/10/52/David-A.-Fedman/3876/article.html\">David Fedman&#39;s 2018 article on the subject</a></p>\n"}
