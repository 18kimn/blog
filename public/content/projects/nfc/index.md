{"data":{"title":"making things with NFCs","subtitle":"to clarify, not NFTs","date":"2021-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"nfc.png"},"content":"<p>Near the beginning of the semester a class I had (Coded Design,\nART750) was talking about locations and embedding data into fairly\nlow-tech devices. Two examples of these are QR codes and NFCs. They&#39;re\nboth simple devices that can hold a tiny amount of information, like a\npiece of text or a link to a website, and can display that information\nwhen asked by a mobile phone.</p>\n<p>These are interesting because they are very, very simple and cheap to\nproduce but can convey a lot of information if used correctly. For\ninstance, if I placed a QR code at my house, I&#39;d know that anyone who\nscans it would be at my house. The QR code doesn&#39;t broadcast the\nlocation of the person who scans it, but by just keeping track of what\nQR codes are placed in which locations I could keep track of scanners&#39;\nlocations without asking for permission.</p>\n<p>Another scenario: Imagine that at a parking lot, there is a sign\nasking you to scan a a QR code to get a website where you can pay for\nparking. You pay $15.00, only to exit the garage and to realize that\nwebsite was a scam! You actually had to pay at a machine near the\nexit, not at some random website.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not a big security issue really. You can do this without QR codes\nand NFC tags too, by just putting up a poster that has a link to a\nwebsite, and so on. But the QR codes and NFC tags kind of act as\nvessels to wrap tiny pieces of information inside of a sort of clock\nof legitimacy. They make something more credible, aesthetically.</p>\n<p>To play with this idea, we were given some NFC tags and asked to make\nsomething. I made a website available at\n<a href=\"https://nfc-homework.glitch.me\">https://nfc-homework.glitch.me</a> that\nhas two functions: a keyboard and a sort of &quot;lockchain.&quot; The keyboard\nhas five NFC tags taped on it, and each holds just a single letter.\nWhen the user enters the website and holds their (Android) phone to\nthe keyboard, a sound corresponding to the note plays.</p>\n<p><img src=\"nfc/nfc.png\" alt=\"the keyboard\"></p>\n<p>The &quot;lockchain&quot; aspect is a bit more complicated. You begin the\nlockchain by scanning a NFC tag, then trying to find a corresponding\n&quot;lock&quot; (another NFC tag) that this &quot;key&quot; can unlock.</p>\n<p>The idea with both of these is that all of their functionality comes\nin the interpretive medium, and not really the NFC tags. The NFC tags\nare just five white circles with five letters of the alphabet embedded\ninside of them. But the interpretive medium can decide what those\nletters mean -- if &quot;C&quot; is like the musical note corresponding to &quot;C&quot;,\nor if &quot;C&quot; is a &quot;key&quot; to the &quot;D&quot; lock, or alternatively the &quot;lock&quot; to\nthe &quot;G&quot; key.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I also helped my friend Yifan Wang with a project on distress signals.\nShe made a book on the topic of signals for another class, discussing\nhistories of calling for help. I helped her add NFC tags to the book\nitself, so that when users hold a phone to certain pages of the book,\nsounds begin playing -- a person dialing in mayday, or the SOS Morse\nCode emergency distress signal.</p>\n<video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n  <source src={Video} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n<p>Here again, the NFC tags themselves are very simple, just containing a\nstring (&quot;mayday&quot;, &quot;sweep up&quot;, etc). They produce sounds only when the\nuser is on the website and scans the tag, and the website can then\nbegin to interpret and produce a response to the signal of the NFC\ntag.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/18kimn/distress-signals\">Github repository</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distres-signals.org\">The website</a></p>\n"}
