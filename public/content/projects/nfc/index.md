Two examples of these are QR codes and\nNFCs. They&#39;re both simple devices that can hold a tiny amount\nof information, like a piece of text or a link to a website,\nand can display that information when asked by a mobile phone.</p>\n<p>These are interesting because they are very, very simple and\ncheap to produce but can convey a lot of information if used\ncorrectly. For instance, if I placed a QR code at my house, I&#39;d\nknow that anyone who scans it would be at my house. The QR code\ndoesn&#39;t broadcast the location of the person who scans it, but\nby just keeping track of what QR codes are placed in which\nlocations I could keep track of scanners&#39; locations without\nasking for permission.</p>\n<p>Another scenario: Imagine that at a parking lot, there is a\nsign asking you to scan a a QR code to get a website where you\ncan pay for parking. You pay $15.00, only to exit the garage\nand to realize that website was a scam! You actually had to pay\nat a machine near the exit, not at some random website.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not a big security issue really. You can do this without\nQR codes and NFC tags too, by just putting up a poster that has\na link to a website, and so on. But the QR codes and NFC tags\nkind of act as vessels to wrap tiny pieces of information\ninside of a sort of clock of legitimacy. They make something\nmore credible, aesthetically.</p>\n<p>To play with this idea, we were given some NFC tags and asked\nto make something. I made a website available at\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://nfc-homework.glitch.me\">https://nfc-homework.glitch.me</a>\nthat has two functions: a keyboard and a sort of &quot;lockchain.&quot;\nThe keyboard has five NFC tags taped on it, and each holds just\na single letter. When the user enters the website and holds\ntheir (Android) phone to the keyboard, a sound corresponding to\nthe note plays.</p>\n<p><img src=\"nfc/nfc.png\" alt=\"the keyboard\"></p>\n<p>The &quot;lockchain&quot; aspect is a bit more complicated. You begin the\nlockchain by scanning a NFC tag, then trying to find a\ncorresponding &quot;lock&quot; (another NFC tag) that this &quot;key&quot; can\nunlock.</p>\n<p>The idea with both of these is that all of their functionality\ncomes in the interpretive medium, and not really the NFC tags.\nThe NFC tags are just five white circles with five letters of\nthe alphabet embedded inside of them. But the interpretive\nmedium can decide what those letters mean -- if &quot;C&quot; is like the\nmusical note corresponding to &quot;C&quot;, or if &quot;C&quot; is a &quot;key&quot; to the\n&quot;D&quot; lock, or alternatively the &quot;lock&quot; to the &quot;G&quot; key.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I also helped my friend Yifan Wang with a project on distress\nsignals. She made a book on the topic of signals for another\nclass, discussing histories of calling for help. I helped her\nadd NFC tags to the book itself, so that when users hold a\nphone to certain pages of the book, sounds begin playing -- a\nperson dialing in mayday, or the SOS Morse Code emergency\ndistress signal.</p>\n<video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n  <source src={Video} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n<p>Here again, the NFC tags themselves are very simple, just\ncontaining a string (&quot;mayday&quot;, &quot;sweep up&quot;, etc). They produce\nsounds only when the user is on the website and scans the tag,\nand the website can then begin to interpret and produce a\nresponse to the signal of the NFC tag.</p>\n<p><a target='_blank'  href=\"https://github.com/18kimn/distress-signals\">Github repository</a></p>\n<p><a target='_blank'  href=\"https://distres-signals.org\">The website</a></p>\n"}
