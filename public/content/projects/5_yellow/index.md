{"data":{"title":"Third World decolonization","date":"2021-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"assembled.png"},"content":"<p>This past winter break, I made a few maps inspired by the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge\">30 day map challenge</a>.\nThis is one of them, responding to the prompt of &quot;yellow.&quot; The maps in\nresponse to the challenge aren&#39;t too polished or meaningful, but they\nwere a fun chance to quickly create things and try to learn some new\ntechnical skills.</p>\n<p>The prompt of &quot;yellow&quot; was pretty difficult to come up with a response\nto. Yellow is a pretty uncommon color, and also tends to overpower or\nclash with lots of colors.</p>\n<p>My response is a map with the theme of &quot;yellow peril supports Black\npower,&quot; a slogan first associated with the racial justice movement of\nthe late 1960s. One way this movement differed from the earlier Civil\nRights Movement is in its scope; it was much broader, aiming to\nrewrite not only the law that defined race and racism but also the\nessential category of the human that the law and many other constructs\nare written over. The scope of the movement was also profoundly\ninternational, coming at a moment when many Third World nations had\nnewly &quot;received&quot; their independence or were fighting to obtain it.\nMovements like the Third World Liberation Front consciously identified\nthemselves with these international struggles (&quot;Third World Liberation\nFront&quot; being a homage to the Algerian National Liberation Front, the\nNational Liberation Front for South Vietnam, and many others), and saw\ntheir pursuit of decolonial curriculum and material rights to safety\nat home as acts of self-determination on the same spectrum as the\nfight for decolonization abroad.</p>\n<img src= \"assembled.gif\" alt=\"GIF of liberation dates of Asian and African countries.\" style=\"width: 70%; position: relative; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, 0)\"/>\n\n<p>This GIF is my one-day attempt to show the process of decolonization\nthrough the 20th century. I scraped Wikipedia for decolonization dates\nand used the <code>maptools</code> package in R for the country shapefiles. I\ntried to show self-determination as an act of speaking a nation into\nexistence. At one point there was no nation, instead there being a\ncolony excluded from the community of nation-states, and then\nparadoxically after decades of struggle the nation is made\ninstantaneously into existence.</p>\n<p>More so than any other map I&#39;ve made for this project, I think this\none deserves criticism. Firstly, it&#39;s just messy. There are countries\nthat don&#39;t neatly fit a single date of &quot;independence&quot; from an imperial\npower. Korea is a good example: in 1945 Korea was liberated, but were\nimmediately and arbitrarily divided according to the whim of two\nmilitary officials from the new imperial power of the U.S. South Asia\nis another good example, where the British Empire&#39;s rule over India\nended in 1947, but Bangladesh did not receive independence from\nPakistan until a few years after. On some level this is a fundamental\nissue that nations cannot adhere to a single rule or a single\nappearance, but in future work I hope to just clean this figure up and\nwork with a better set of rules to make it look nicer.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the map seems only to suggest that the nations pop into\nexistence suddenly, and does not show how sudden independence nearly\nalways came after years and years of slow struggle. This can also be\nworked on by tweaking the transparency of states up to the year of\nliberation.</p>\n"}
