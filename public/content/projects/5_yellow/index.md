{"data":{"title":"Third World decolonization","date":"2021-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"assembled.png"},"toc":[],"content":"<p>This past winter break, I made a few maps inspired by the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge\">30 day map challenge</a>.\nThis is one of them, responding to the prompt of &quot;yellow.&quot; The\nmaps in response to the challenge aren&#39;t too polished or\nmeaningful, but they were a fun chance to quickly create things\nand try to learn some new technical skills.</p>\n<p>The prompt of &quot;yellow&quot; was pretty difficult to come up with a\nresponse to. Yellow is a pretty uncommon color, and also tends\nto overpower or clash with lots of colors.</p>\n<p>My response is a map with the theme of &quot;yellow peril supports\nBlack power,&quot; a slogan first associated with the racial justice\nmovement of the late 1960s. One way this movement differed from\nthe earlier Civil Rights Movement is in its scope; it was much\nbroader, aiming to rewrite not only the law that defined race\nand racism but also the essential category of the human that\nthe law and many other constructs are written over. The scope\nof the movement was also profoundly international, coming at a\nmoment when many Third World nations had newly &quot;received&quot; their\nindependence or were fighting to obtain it. Movements like the\nThird World Liberation Front consciously identified themselves\nwith these international struggles (&quot;Third World Liberation\nFront&quot; being a homage to the Algerian National Liberation\nFront, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam, and\nmany others), and saw their pursuit of decolonial curriculum\nand material rights to safety at home as acts of\nself-determination on the same spectrum as the fight for\ndecolonization abroad.</p>\n<img src= \"assembled.gif\" alt=\"GIF of liberation dates of Asian and African countries.\" style=\"width: 70%; position: relative; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, 0)\"/>\n\n<p>This GIF is my one-day attempt to show the process of\ndecolonization through the 20th century. I scraped Wikipedia\nfor decolonization dates and used the <code>maptools</code> package in R\nfor the country shapefiles. I tried to show self-determination\nas an act of speaking a nation into existence. At one point\nthere was no nation, instead there being a colony excluded from\nthe community of nation-states, and then paradoxically after\ndecades of struggle the nation is made instantaneously into\nexistence.</p>\n<p>More so than any other map I&#39;ve made for this project, I think\nthis one deserves criticism. Firstly, it&#39;s just messy. There\nare countries that don&#39;t neatly fit a single date of\n&quot;independence&quot; from an imperial power. Korea is a good example:\nin 1945 Korea was liberated, but were immediately and\narbitrarily divided according to the whim of two military\nofficials from the new imperial power of the U.S. South Asia is\nanother good example, where the British Empire&#39;s rule over\nIndia ended in 1947, but Bangladesh did not receive\nindependence from Pakistan until a few years after. On some\nlevel this is a fundamental issue that nations cannot adhere to\na single rule or a single appearance, but in future work I hope\nto just clean this figure up and work with a better set of\nrules to make it look nicer.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the map seems only to suggest that the nations pop\ninto existence suddenly, and does not show how sudden\nindependence nearly always came after years and years of slow\nstruggle. This can also be worked on by tweaking the\ntransparency of states up to the year of liberation.</p>\n"}
