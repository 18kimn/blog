Hexagonal maps let us\nrepresent areas equally and contiguously, which is helpful for\nrepresenting electoral districts that may have disproportionate\nareas but an equal number of votes in a legislature. Hexagonal\nmaps also provide a more &quot;continuous&quot; picture of space compared\nto square grid maps, which create straight lines and could\nexaggerate geographical divisions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"4_hexagons/house.png\" alt=\"Connectict House of Representatives\"></p>\n<p>Connecticut has a bit of a unique system in that each Senate\nDistrict (of which there are 36) and each House District (151)\nelects just one representative. This lets us assign each\ndistrict just one name and one color for the associated party,\nproviding a fairly neat map.</p>\n<p><img src=\"4_hexagons/senate.png\" alt=\"Connecticut Senate\"></p>\n<p>Still, the map was fairly difficult to code. I could have done\nthis in Photoshop or Figma more easily, but I was set on\nprogrammatically creating hexagons and assigning existing\ndistricts to new shapes in a one-to-one fashion. Though this\ntook a while to figure out, eventually I was able to set up a\nmethod to assign an arbitrary set of polygons each to their own\nnew hexagon. I&#39;ll clean it up someday and put on Github, along\nwith all of the other source code for this map series.</p>\n"}
