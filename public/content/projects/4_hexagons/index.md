Hexagonal maps let us represent areas equally and\ncontiguously, which is helpful for representing electoral districts\nthat may have disproportionate areas but an equal number of votes in a\nlegislature. Hexagonal maps also provide a more &quot;continuous&quot; picture\nof space compared to square grid maps, which create straight lines and\ncould exaggerate geographical divisions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"4_hexagons/house.png\" alt=\"Connectict House of Representatives\"></p>\n<p>Connecticut has a bit of a unique system in that each Senate District\n(of which there are 36) and each House District (151) elects just one\nrepresentative. This lets us assign each district just one name and\none color for the associated party, providing a fairly neat map.</p>\n<p><img src=\"4_hexagons/senate.png\" alt=\"Connecticut Senate\"></p>\n<p>Still, the map was fairly difficult to code. I could have done this in\nPhotoshop or Figma more easily, but I was set on programmatically\ncreating hexagons and assigning existing districts to new shapes in a\none-to-one fashion. Though this took a while to figure out, eventually\nI was able to set up a method to assign an arbitrary set of polygons\neach to their own new hexagon. I&#39;ll clean it up someday and put on\nGithub, along with all of the other source code for this map series.</p>\n"}
