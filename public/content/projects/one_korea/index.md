{"data":{"title":"Representing a unified Korea","date":"2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"one_kor.png"},"toc":[],"content":"<p>Korea was divided into two in 1945, when on August 15th (now\n&quot;Liberation Day&quot;) Korea was released from the rule of the\nJapanese Empire.</p>\n<p>Korea was liberated from Japan through blood (over 20,000\nKoreans died as a result of the bombings of Hiroshima and\nNagasaki), and in the new state of &quot;freedom&quot; the South Korean\ngovernment and the United States military prevented all efforts\nfor unification and anti-imperialism. In the ten years after\n&quot;freedom&quot;, 110,000 were killed in the Bodo League massacre,\n30,000 were killed in the Jeju Island uprising while the\nremaining 40,000 fled to Japan, 90,000 men drafted by the\nSyngman Rhee regime died of starvation and disease in the\nNational Defense Corps Incident, and 2,000 were killed in the\nYeosu-Suncheon rebellion. In total, almost 25% of the Korean\npopulation were killed through the Korean War.</p>\n<p>Guns and death were one method of destruction. Others were the\nuse of napalm and the U.S.&#39; scorched earth policies to prevent\nrecovery of the land, the continuous bombing of industrial\ntargets on both sides of the 38th parallel by the U.S.\ngovernment until no more &quot;worthy&quot; targets were left, and the\ncontinued subjugation of Korean women to sex slavery that had\nbegun under the Japanese empire.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to convey the scale of imperial violence on a\nshort blog post, and I hope not to normalize the bloodshed that\nis yet ongoing. I refer to the violence of the past to\nillustrate the violent history of the present, or to emphasize\nthat the nation today is created through physical,\npsychological, cultural, and political destruction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"one_korea/one_kor.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I dream of Korea by seeing what it is not: I dream of\nunification by despairing at the ever-visible division, I dream\nof a national identity by seeing the ways this has been\ndestroyed and rebuilt as capitalist necolony, I dream of peace\nby studying the ongonig violence.</p>\n<p>The map here inverts the beautiful Korean reunification flag, a\npositivist vision of a unified nation often flown at sporting\nevents as a symbolic gesture of sisterhood. Where the\nreunification flag uses a solid block of blue, I leave the\nnation completely white and use the blue to envelop the nation\nin a semitransparent shimmer. The colors of the ROK and DPRK\nflags are added in large spirals. Though these patterns were\ncreated through almost entirely random means through the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise\">simplex</a> noise\ngenerating algorithm, some visual cues emerge that remind us of\nthis nation&#39;s history. Bright red points fly out of the West\nside of Korea, almost like a spray of blood; at other points,\nthe blue and black points combine to make almost a rocket flame\nto remind the viewer of the violent warheads that even today\nare brought to the penninsula through the U.S.&#39; expansion of\nthe THAAD &quot;anti-missile&quot; defense system.</p>\n<p>This map uses the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://github.com/djnavarro/jasmines\">jasmines</a> and\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://ambient.data-imaginist.com/\">ambient</a> packages in R.\nCode is available upon request.
