{"data":{"title":"Representing a unified Korea","date":"2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","banner":"one_kor.png"},"content":"<p>Korea was divided into two in 1945, when on August 15th (now\n&quot;Liberation Day&quot;) Korea was released from the rule of the Japanese\nEmpire.</p>\n<p>Korea was liberated from Japan through blood (over 20,000 Koreans died\nas a result of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), and in the new\nstate of &quot;freedom&quot; the South Korean government and the United States\nmilitary prevented all efforts for unification and anti-imperialism.\nIn the ten years after &quot;freedom&quot;, 110,000 were killed in the Bodo\nLeague massacre, 30,000 were killed in the Jeju Island uprising while\nthe remaining 40,000 fled to Japan, 90,000 men drafted by the Syngman\nRhee regime died of starvation and disease in the National Defense\nCorps Incident, and 2,000 were killed in the Yeosu-Suncheon rebellion.\nIn total, almost 25% of the Korean population were killed through the\nKorean War.</p>\n<p>Guns and death were one method of destruction. Others were the use of\nnapalm and the U.S.&#39; scorched earth policies to prevent recovery of\nthe land, the continuous bombing of industrial targets on both sides\nof the 38th parallel by the U.S. government until no more &quot;worthy&quot;\ntargets were left, and the continued subjugation of Korean women to\nsex slavery that had begun under the Japanese empire.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to convey the scale of imperial violence on a short\nblog post, and I hope not to normalize the bloodshed that is yet\nongoing. I refer to the violence of the past to illustrate the violent\nhistory of the present, or to emphasize that the nation today is\ncreated through physical, psychological, cultural, and political\ndestruction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"one_korea/one_kor.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I dream of Korea by seeing what it is not: I dream of unification by\ndespairing at the ever-visible division, I dream of a national\nidentity by seeing the ways this has been destroyed and rebuilt as\ncapitalist necolony, I dream of peace by studying the ongonig\nviolence.</p>\n<p>The map here inverts the beautiful Korean reunification flag, a\npositivist vision of a unified nation often flown at sporting events\nas a symbolic gesture of sisterhood. Where the reunification flag uses\na solid block of blue, I leave the nation completely white and use the\nblue to envelop the nation in a semitransparent shimmer. The colors of\nthe ROK and DPRK flags are added in large spirals. Though these\npatterns were created through almost entirely random means through the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise\">simplex</a> noise\ngenerating algorithm, some visual cues emerge that remind us of this\nnation&#39;s history. Bright red points fly out of the West side of Korea,\nalmost like a spray of blood; at other points, the blue and black\npoints combine to make almost a rocket flame to remind the viewer of\nthe violent warheads that even today are brought to the penninsula\nthrough the U.S.&#39; expansion of the THAAD &quot;anti-missile&quot; defense\nsystem.</p>\n<p>This map uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/djnavarro/jasmines\">jasmines</a>\nand <a href=\"https://ambient.data-imaginist.com/\">ambient</a> packages in R.
