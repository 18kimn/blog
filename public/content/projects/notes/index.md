An associated document will pop up\nin the sidebar. You can move the entire screen by dragging, or zoom in\nby scrolling. Also check out the controls in the top left, to adjust\nthe forces in this document.</p>\n<p>Each circle is a document or folder containing documents. They\nrepresent a single thought, or a point where multiple thoughts\nconverge. Sometimes these are free-form or prose written in markdown;\nother times they&#39;re more structured thoughts in Typescript/JavaScript\nin R that I wrote for a project.</p>\n<p>Each line between circles is a connection between these thoughts. A\nlot of them are &quot;structural&quot; connections, meaning parent folders\nconnected to document children. Some of them are conceptual\nconnections, where I linked to another document while I was writing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-this\">why is this</h2>\n<p>Together, these lines and circles are my attempt to make a map of my\nbrain.</p>\n<p>I feel like I&#39;ve been going insane over the past year. I can&#39;t\nremember things, I can&#39;t speak or think coherently, I always lose my\ntrain of thought.</p>\n<p>I started to organize my thoughts into text, trying to pin down things\nthat were floating around and make them permanent and structured.\nPermanent in the sense that I can look back and remember what my brain\nalone cannot, structured in the sense that there are unique places for\neach thought and a way for them to relate to each other.</p>\n<p>Brains are chaotic and incomprehensible; maps by nature try to assign\norder to things and make things comprehensible by assigning value to\nlocations. So this is my map of my brain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-this\">how is this</h2>\n<p>This website was made through Svelte, which I think is the ... sort of\nsustainable future for web development, on the opposite end of most\nweb3/crypto tech. The actual graph was made through d3-force, with\nhelp from d3-zoom and d3-drag.</p>\n<p>Source code can be viewed on Gitlab\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/18kimn-personal/notes\">here</a>, and the actual notes\nrepository can be viewed on Github\n<a href=\"https://github.com/18kimn/vault\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"last-thoughts\">last thoughts</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m hoping to turn this into a more general tool, e.g. you could point\nit at a folder on your computer and it makes this for you. But I&#39;m\nkinda tired of working on this now, so I&#39;m not sure.</p>\n"}
