The project is an\nattempt to think about how Yaleâ€™s history as a colonial\ninstitution remains embedded in its architecture and landscape\nin the present-day, and to highlight sites where Yale students\nand New Haven residents have changed the course of the\nuniversityâ€™s history through remarkable moments of struggle.\nThis project presents this through an interactive map.</p>\n<p>This project is adapted from an in-person tour developed by\nEsul Burton and Janis Jin in Summer 2019 for the Cultural\nConnections pre-orientation program at Yale. At that time, the\nproject was called the &quot;Yale Critical History Tour.&quot; Since\nthen, the project has expanded somewhat in scope due to work\nfrom students in Professor Talya Zemach-Bersin&#39;s Fall 2020\ninteration of the seminar Education and Empire. Editors Amy Kim\nand Jose Garcia, along with Mia Coates, Mona Mahadevan, Blanca\nTallaj, Natalie Troy, Juma Sei, and Sasha Lee, created a zine\ntitled &quot;The Yale Detour.&quot; This zine can be seen on Flipsnack\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://www.flipsnack.com/yaledetours/yale-detours.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>These two tours (or &quot;detours&quot;) were developed separately, but\nthey have very similar goals. These histories pushed back\nagainst the cheery versions of Yale history spread by vetted\nand trained student employees on Yale&#39;s official tour guides.\nRather than being remnants or artifacts of the past, these\nhistories are ongoing ones that Yale refuses to denounce and\neven enthusiastically carries forth, from the takeover and\nmanagement of the &quot;Shops on Broadway&quot; (a Yale designation) to\nthe funding and namesake of the Schwarzman Center that opened\nin 2021. These histories aren&#39;t lessons from Yale&#39;s past that\nwe can learn from, but a story of an ongoing struggle; a\ncolonial history of the present. Esul and Janis, joined by\nCollin Bentley, began developing a interactive, digital version\nof the Yale Critical History Tour in 2020. This digital version\nwas eventually continued by myself (Nathan Kim), Resty Fufunan,\nDora Guo, Amy Kim, and Jose Garcia as the Yale Detour.</p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\" id=\"implementation\">Implementation<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#implementation\">#</a></h2><p>My main contribution to this project was building out the\ntechnical architecture used for the site.<sup id=\"fn-1\"><a href=\"#note-1\">1</a></sup> Janis\nsuggested to me the possibility of continuing the work she,\nEsul, and Collin had begun. I was first a bit unsure because I\nhad very little experience with web development at the time,\nbut enthusiastically accepted after a summer of working with\nthe Anti-Eviction Mapping Project and learning React and other\nweb technologies while doing so.</p>\n<p>The initial site was built using Mapbox GL for the map\ncomponent, React as its component system, Netlify as a content\nmanagement system, and Bootstrap as a styling system. This was\nthanks to the work of Collin Bentley. That worked really well,\nand sporadically throughout Fall 2021 I expanded on that and\nfocused on making the map zoom work well, adjusting the map\nstyle, making the carousel component work correctly, and other\nfeatures.</p>\n<p>At the end of the semester, I had learned quite a bit more\nabout web development in general and more importantly had\ncemented a few principles that I felt made for more sustainable\nweb development, both for the developer and for the end user.\nSo I rewrote the site to use Leaflet as the map component,\nusing Svelte as the component architecture, and writing sites\nin raw markdown with the assistance of Gitlab&#39;s wiki system.\nWith wireframes contributed by our designer Dora Guo, I also\nredid our styling system to not depend on any third\nparty-dependencies. I felt that this was more minimal, offered\nmore control to the developer, cut down the bundle size from\n~300kB to ~30kB with only a single dependency (leaflet), and\noverall just felt like the correct solution. More important\nthan those sort of quality-of-life and performance benefits,\nthis structure offers <em>ownership</em> to the builders of the Yale\nDetour, and that was the most important ideal to me.</p>\n<p>More details can be found on our\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://gitlab.com/18kimn/yale-detour/-/wikis/home\">Gitlab wiki</a>,\nwhich contains details about our technical process and\ncontributor guidelines.</p>\n<hr/><ol><li id=\"note-1\">I also served as a\nsort of general coordinator, but that process was informal and\ndisorganized enough so I will not elaborate on it here. <a class=\"backlink\" href=\"#fn-1\">â†©</a></li></ol>"}
