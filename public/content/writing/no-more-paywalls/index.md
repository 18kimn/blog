There&#39;s a lot more that can be said\nthere by people more eloquent and politically developed than I,\nbut there is also no need to. It&#39;s as simple as that --\n<em>knowledge should be free</em>.</p>\n<p>This page is a resource list describing how to access paywalled\nand restricted content, and especially academic content, for\nfree.</p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\" id=\"academic-books\">Academic books<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#academic-books\">#</a></h2><p>Go to <a target='_blank'  href=\"https://libgen.is\">Library Genesis (LibGen)</a> and try to\nfind it there. LibGen&#39;s search parameter is a little sensitive,\nso I would try a few keywords instead of (for example) the full\ntitle, printing press and publicatoin year.</p>\n<p>LibGen has a lot, but it doesn&#39;t have everything; if it\ndoesn&#39;t, go to the\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/\">Ask For PDFs from People With Institutional Access</a>\nFacebook group. Search for the resource there, and check out\nthe flowchart in the group banner to see if any of those\nresources have it available. If they don&#39;t, ask nicely if\nanyone can send a PDF of the book.</p>\n<p>If that route doesn&#39;t work, you may want to try asking on\n<a target='_blank'  href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AAAARG/\">r/AAAARG</a> for access to the\nAAAARG archive. This mostly works for older philosophy texts\nand other books in the humanities.</p>\n<p>If none of those work, you can try paying for an eBook from a\nretail outlet like Google Books, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble,\nand &quot;returning&quot; it to get a refund. This is somewhat unsafe.</p>\n<p>If none of these work, your book may only be available in\nprint. Check on <a target='_blank'  href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/\">worldcat.org</a> to\nsee if this is the case. You may be out of luck.</p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\" id=\"academic-articles\">Academic articles<a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#frontmatter\">ðŸ ‘</a><a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#academic-articles\">#</a></h2><ol>\n<li>Find and copy the DOI of the article, or digital object\nidentifier.
