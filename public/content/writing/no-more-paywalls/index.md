There&#39;s a lot more that can be said there by\npeople more eloquent and politically developed than I, but there is\nalso no need to. It&#39;s as simple as that -- <em>knowledge should be free</em>.</p>\n<p>This page is a resource list describing how to access paywalled and\nrestricted content, and especially academic content, for free.</p>\n<h3 id=\"academic-books\">Academic books</h3>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://libgen.is\">Library Genesis (LibGen)</a> and try to find it\nthere. LibGen&#39;s search parameter is a little sensitive, so I would try\na few keywords instead of (for example) the full title, printing press\nand publicatoin year.</p>\n<p>LibGen has a lot, but it doesn&#39;t have everything; if it doesn&#39;t, go to\nthe\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/\">Ask For PDFs from People With Institutional Access</a>\nFacebook group. Search for the resource there, and check out the\nflowchart in the group banner to see if any of those resources have it\navailable. If they don&#39;t, ask nicely if anyone can send a PDF of the\nbook.</p>\n<p>If that route doesn&#39;t work, you may want to try asking on\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AAAARG/\">r/AAAARG</a> for access to the AAAARG\narchive. This mostly works for older philosophy texts and other books\nin the humanities.</p>\n<p>If none of those work, you can try paying for an eBook from a retail\noutlet like Google Books, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble, and &quot;returning&quot;\nit to get a refund. This is somewhat unsafe.</p>\n<p>If none of these work, your book may only be available in print. Check\non <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/\">worldcat.org</a> to see if this is the\ncase. You may be out of luck.</p>\n<h3 id=\"academic-articles\">Academic articles</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Find and copy the DOI of the article, or digital object identifier.\nThis is essentially an ID for academic articles. If you can&#39;t find\nit immediately on the site of the article, you can search for it on\n<a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/guestquery/\">CrossRef</a></li>\n<li>Go to SciHub and paste it. SciHub&#39;s URL changes quite frequently\nbecause of legal issues, so the best way is just to go to Google\nand find the current one in your country.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is an international network of scholars contributing their\ncredentials and labor to make SciHub work, so I&#39;ve never had an issue\nwith it. But in case of trouble,^[An example would be when SciHub\nstopped uploading content due to legal battles at the beginning of\n2021] you can try some of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly email the authors of the resource. They are usually very\nkind!!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/\">Ask For PDFs from People With Institutional Access</a>\nas mentioned above. Please follow their contributor guidelines :)</li>\n<li>Ask on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/\">r/Scholar</a>.</li>\n<li>post with the <strong>#ICanHazPDF</strong> hashtag on Twitter (don&#39;t laugh)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"non-academic-articles\">Non-academic articles</h3>\n<p>Prepend <strong>12ft.io</strong> to the beginning of the URL. You can also install\nthe 12ft.io browser extension, or a similar one like the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome\">Bypass Paywalls</a>\nextension on Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.</p>\n<p>For a few other Medium-based sites like Towards Data Science, I also\nlike to use\n<a href=\"https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited\">Medium Unlimited</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"share-the-resources\">Share the resources</h3>\n<p>If you obtained a text through any means other than free and\naccessible resources, you have the opportunity to share that resource\nand ensure others won&#39;t have to jump through the hoops you did. Here\nare a few notes on doing so.</p>\n<p>Before sharing, we have to make sure the file is shareable. Resources\noften have a lock called a DRM on them to ensure that a PDF for you\ncan&#39;t be opened on any other machine besides your own.^[Some\nindicators for the case is if you &quot;borrowed&quot; an eBook (what the hell\nis even borrowing an eBook, anyhow), have to open the file through\nAdobe Digital Editions, or got it from a retail outlet] If this is the\ncase, download the eBook viewer\n<a href=\"https://calibre-ebook.com/download\">Calibre</a> and use a plugin called\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/wiki/Exactly-how-to-remove-DRM\">DeDRM</a>\nto remove it.</p>\n<p>If you are sure the file is shareable, you can upload it to the\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/\">Ask for PDFs</a>\nFacebook Group and to\n<a href=\"https://wiki.mhut.org/content:how_to_upload\">LibGen</a>. If you are on\nthe tech-y side, you might also consider setting up and hosting a\n<a href=\"https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/server.html\">Calibre server</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"last-thoughts\">Last thoughts</h3>\n<p>You can email me at <a href=\"mailto:&#x6e;&#x61;&#116;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#x2e;&#107;&#105;&#109;&#x40;&#x79;&#x61;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#x65;&#x64;&#117;\">&#x6e;&#x61;&#116;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#x2e;&#107;&#105;&#109;&#x40;&#x79;&#x61;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#x65;&#x64;&#117;</a>.
