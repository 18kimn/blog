            Iâ€™m a senior at Yale College double majoring in Ethnicity, Race, & Migration as well as Statistics & Data Science.
            I am broadly interested in a critical study of space and race, especially in how actions along these dimensions can destroy or advance global imperialism.
            I have related interests in data visualization and interactive presentations. My strengths are in the R tidyverse, and I am also familiar
            with the data.table, Shiny, sf, and spatstat packages. I also have experience working in Python, Stata, Tableau, and Excel.

            This summer, I&apos;m working with the <Link to='https://antievictionmap.com/'>Anti-Eviction Mapping Project,</Link> a tenant organizing collective 
            and digital cartography group based out of San Francisco. I&apos;m also continuing research with Professor Emma 
            Zang of Yale Sociology and work with local New Haven nonprofit DataHaven. On campus, I am part of the Asian Students for Ethnic Studies group (formerly the
            Asian American Studies Task Force) and perform with Korean drum troup UNITY. Previously, I served as Programming Chair for the Asian American Students Alliance,
            was a Social Chair for the Korean American Students at Yale and was a Dwight Hall Urban Fellow, through which I worked at local nonprofit LEAP.
