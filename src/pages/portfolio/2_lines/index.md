For day one ("lines"), I created a simple map of Connecticut using its local railroads, rivers, and roads. Colors are purposefully chosen to emphasize these transportation networks as veins and arteries of the state of Connecticut.

This map deserves some criticism. It firstly represents Connecticut as a standalone body instead of as an administrative entity, a metaphor that may be attractive but is inaccurate for most conversations. It also tries to portray the land as a living being flowing with blood and resources, but pays no respect to the Indigenous modes of land curatorship that originally had such an understanding of Connecticut land. Finally, it just doesn't look good; maybe I could have added a satellite or shaded relief underneath these lines for some context and aesthetic appeal. 

Still, this is all just a sketch, good enough for a few hours of work.
