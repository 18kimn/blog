title: "NULL: Prison gerrymandering and migration"

Here's another map that took a few days to make and is still unfinished as it is. For the theme of `NULL`, I created a map to represents prison gerrymandering, or the practice of counting incarcerated individuals in their location of imprisonment rather than in their home communities for the Census and for legislative redistricting. With prison gerrymandering, population and political power are artificially inflated in an exo-cartographic manuever: without drawing any new lines on a map, districts of imprisonment gain representative power and districts hit most heavily by the pandemic of mass incarceration lose representative power. 

The theme of `NULL` in the Month of Maps series fits this pattern well. Some individuals are effectively erased from the hegemonic sphere of political influence (prisoners in nearly every state lose their right to vote), creating a void or a `NULL` space. 

My response was an animated cartogram that shows some congressional districts increasing in size due to this usurpation of political power and others decreasing or disappearing as a result.

This was challenging to make on two fronts. Firstly, there is no authoritative source for the net increases and decreases due to population migration, and thus the data represented here is problematic for several reasons. I used the [Vera Institute's Incarceration Trends](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends) dataset for the home counties of those imprisoned as well as the [Prison Policy Initiative's Data Toolbox](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/) to find the group quarters population of each block that contains a prison. I then used a point-to-polygon spatial join to merge prisons onto counties, then summarized everything to the county level for where there were two or more prisons per county. The next step was to create intersections between counties and legislative districts, after which I used the area of each county that had been split to divide a county's population statistics into different legislative districts (Los Angeles County is one example of such a county that resides in multiple congressional districts). I added all of these together by congressional district to create a congressional-district-level profile. Finally, I calculated "population change due to prisons" as the difference between the population of a congressional district due to prisons and the population of the congressional district who had been imprisoned. If more of the population in a district came from a prison as had been sent to a prison, the town effectively experienced an increase in population due to a local prison. If more of the population in a district had been sent to a prison than had come from a prison, this is an indicator of population shrinkage.  

This method "works" as in it returns a dataset of net population changes due to prisons in the area, but it is frustrating and incomplete for many reasons and I hope that this GIF is only seen as a learning student's work-in-progress and not a definitive visualization of prison gerrymandering in the United States. Firstly, the cobbling together of various sources added more uncertainty and "inaccuracy" at every step. The Vera Institute's data in particular was incomplete, as 563 counties in 2010 were missing incarceration data. The polygon-to-polygon spatial join from counties onto legislative districts is also methodologically questionable; In weighting by area for the spatial join, I made the assumption that a county's prison incarceration profile was equally distributed across the county, but this assumption is inaccurate and especially misleading in counties that encompass cities. 

The second front I was challenged on were the technical and aesthetic problems in creating the visualization. I had never made a cartogram before, and my home language of R proved a bit tedious and unwieldy for doing so.[^1] The only guides I could find along for the task in R were a bit outdated and didn't use the `sf` grammar of spatial data in R that has emerged as the cleanest and most sensible paradigm for manipulating geometries. Perhaps due to my inexperience and lack of foresight, I realized too late that the U.S. has several hundred too many congressional districts to make for an attractive cartogram -- although we see expansion and contraction, it's too crowded to highlight strong trends in the data. Animating the graphic also proved to be challenging. The `transformr` package in R had recently been released to produce animation frames for spatial data, but bugs here prevented me from making a clean set of frames. I eventually had to delete the problem state of Montana entirely as a workaround. I never found out why Montana specifically kept returning errors, and if it was an issue with how `cartogram` assembles `sf` objects or with how `transformr` manipulates them. 


Still, like all items in this series, making this graphic was a learning process, and each problem illuminated just as much as it obfuscated. Some key takeaways for a better graphic: 

1. Localize. Focus on a state with a substantial number of counties, one with large enough population to have a meaningful trend of prison migration or gerrymandering. California or New York could work. 
2. Use a medium like QGIS to create the cartogram, and return to R for the task of animation. I trust QGIS as a well-developed medium made specifically for cartography, whereas tools in R are often made as a weekend project by an individual whose profession is only tangentially related to the field I intend to use the tool for. 
3. Merge prisons directly onto legislative districts instead of summarizing onto the county-level first. This avoids part of the distortion of statistics from the county-to-congressional-district merge. 
4. Instead of weighting by area, use a spatial join to merge Census block-level population data onto county-legislative intersections, then weight by this population data instead of by area. In simpler terms, use people to weight, not land, because people aren't distributed evenly across land. 

Hopefully I can clean this up and upload a cleaner graphic when I have the chance. 

[^1]: Coming into the project, I had thought that R would be well-suited for creating cartograms as a more computational/statistical/technical/flexible medium than other popular software like QGIS or ArcGIS. I've realized that the ecosystem of cartography in R isn't as developed as in other software (even the `cartogram` package I used is no longer maintained by its creator), and perhaps I was also mistaken that GUI-based software wouldn't be flexible enough to manipulate geometries.
