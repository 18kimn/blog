I grew up in Philadelphia, a city segregated by a few geographic markers. Broad Street separates the mostly Black and mostly Latino neighborhoods of North Philly, the Schulykill river separates University City from Center City. A few geographic markers encompass my entire childhood, spent going to and from school and downtown and back again with only the one or two subway lines in the city. 

The map below is obnoxiously simple to illustrate how saliently this small handful of routes, lines, and geographic markers have become to me. The route from my childhood home to the house my family moved to in October 2019, Hunting Park (which my childhood neighborhood is named after), the two subway lines, the two rivers.
