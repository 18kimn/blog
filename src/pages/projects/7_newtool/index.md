title: "Map with a new tool: Seoul, songs, spaces"

This past winter break, I made a few maps inspired by the [30 day map challenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge). This is one of them, responding to the prompt of "map with a new tool." The maps in response to the challenge aren't too polished or meaningful, but they were a fun chance to quickly create things and try to learn some new technical skills. 

Over the past few months, I've developed a strong interest in Korean hip-hop, R&B, and Indie. I realized that a lot of these songs are written about specific places in Seoul, while the same cannot be said about many other genres or locations (e.g. songs about New York neighborhoods are not as common). I collected a few here and laid them over a modified version of the Mapbox Japan theme. The new tool I used here was Figma, a graphic design software that is surprisingly intuitive to use.

This map is one that I think has a lot of potential, but still needs more time and thought to clarify its ideas. Why do artists write songs about Seoul or places in Seoul in the first place -- how is space given meaning before the song is written? What do the songs say about these places, and what effect do they have on how the city as a whole is imagined? Diving into the songs' lyrics, their genres, and the biographies of these artists would lend a lot of insight into these questions. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project related to this.
