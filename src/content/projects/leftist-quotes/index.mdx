import Quote from './Quote.js'
import Codeblock from '../../../components/Codeblock.js'

## Intro

As a celebration for the end of summer (joke), I threw together a super, super simple API to interact with 778 communist/leftist quotes, all from marxists.org.

There are three endpoints:

**/** (the root): returns a random quote

**/daily** : returns a single quote every day, matches with the [marxists.org quote-a-day page](https://www.marxists.org/subject/quotes/index.htm).

**/all-quotes** : returns all quotes.

Quotes are returned as objects in the form:

- body: the text of the quote
- link: the link to a page on marxists.org with the associated reading
- attribution: the name of the author and often the date or title of the original text

The first two routes return a single object, and the last route returns an array of objects.

Source code is hosted at [github.con/18kimn/leftist-quotes](https://www.github.con/18kimn/leftist-quotes)

## An example

Click the card below to refresh the shown quote. Clicking the attribution takes you to the associated reading on [marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org).

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <Quote></Quote>
</div>

<Codeblock>

```javascript
import React, {useState, useCallback, useEffect} from 'react'
import {Card, CardActionArea} from '@material-ui/core'
// some styling is skipped
const Quote = () => {
  const [quote, setQuote] = useState()
  const fetchQuote = useCallback(() => {
    fetch('https://www.leftist-quotes.com/')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setQuote(data))
      .catch((err) => console.log(err))
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchQuote()
  }, [fetchQuote])

  if (!quote) return null
  return (
    <Card style={styles.card}>
      <CardActionArea onClick={fetchQuote}>
        <p>{quote.body}</p>
        <br />
      </CardActionArea>
      <a href={quote.link}>
        <p>{quote.attribution}</p>
      </a>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

</Codeblock>

## on learning

This tool was built through express.js, with the data preprocessed through R and the entire site hosted on Heroku. It's incredibly simple, so I just threw everything in the root directory instead of creating src/ or static/ folders and so on.

This is my first API that I've built, which was exciting and definitely a learning experience. Two basic those things I learned:

- backend architecture: how do we set up GET requests? Where does this deploy?
- Web architecture in general: what are DNS requests and forwarding?

The second point was especially confusing and tedious, as I had to reroute https://leftist-quotes.com, www.leftist-quotes.com, and so on all to the same root site.

The other thing I realized while scraping the marxists.org webpage was that the marxists.org website was built in the stone ages. Every single quote was placed inside of a `document.write(<p>...</p>)` statement, and the entire page was essentially a single `switch` statement that was nearly eight hundred clauses long. On one hand, that must have taken a ridiculously long time to make since every quote had to be manually coded and formatted. On the other hand, it's not performant as the page has to load a few megabytes more than it needs and anyone editing it in the future would probably be extremely frustrated.

## Next steps

I hope to add more quotes eventually,
