<h2>My notes</h2>
<p>
  This is my notebook, just things I jot into vim as I go
  throughout my day and want to keep thinking about later.
  It's included as part of this website to give additional
  samples of things I'm thinking about. I'm working towards
  turning this into a proper Zettelkasten system. Warning:
  full of typos, inaccuracies, incorrect statements,
  unfinished and run-on sentences, and missing citations.
</p>
<p>
  I've removed links to this page from elsewhere on the
  site, as these thoughts aren't really presentation-ready.
  At the same time, I'll keep all of them public because I
  do think it's fun to keep a piece of scrap paper out in
  the wild. Fully formed thoughts are more useful than
  half-formed ones, but the unfinished thoughts offer us
  some beauty too.
