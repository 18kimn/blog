## TLDR

This post contains some reflections on software gone
"wrong," and human intent embedded in such statements. I
point out that the most technical of software is not outside
of the realm of intent and human direction, and describe
some ways this manifests.

The discussion in this post is partially intended to
motivate those in STS and tech criticism to carefully about
our word choice, but at a more basic level to reveal the
meaning already present in how we speak without our
knowledge, and how those directions highlighted by word
choice structure our thoughts and actions.

## Glitches and bugs

Glitches and bugs are two terms used to describe a deviance
from expected reality for a piece of software. The
dictionary definitions for these are essentially
interchangeable.

But there's obviously some differences in how we use them.
We don't say "glitch in the matrix" when we see a black cat
twice, just as we don't say "

- more than a glitch
  - broussard uses "glitch" to reinforce the momentary,
    non-logical
- glitch in the matrix
- glitch

- bugs
  - evictorbook bugs
  -

The catch is that this distinction is not perfect. Popular
legend (incorrectly) holds that "bug" was coined by
programming pioneer Grace Hopper finding a literal bug in
the Harvard Mark II computer.^[She did not actually coin the
term "bug," as several people have noted.] One can imagine
this is very much not a problem with logic, as bugs have
been described, and is entirely due to outside factors that
are momentary and hard to control, the way a glitch is, but
this legend has been canonized as a story of a "bug," not a
glitch.
