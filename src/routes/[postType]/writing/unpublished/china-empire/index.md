title: China is not creating a "new world empire"
subtitle: Saying it does is ill-informed and ahistorical

- intro: the argument I want to debunk
  - china gives a lot of money to countries, then forces
    them to give china power when the debt inevitably piles
    up
- why and when debt is bad
  - the main vehicle for this kind of maneuver in the past
    fifty years has been the IMF's policies of
    conditionality that force countries to change in order
    to get assistance with debt
- case study: sri lanka
  - china didn't even contribute most of the debt that led
    to imf intervention
  - it also wasn't foreign debtors alone that led to crisis,
    but political turmoil
  - it wasn't china that demanded sri lanka open its port to
    foreign trade, it was the imf
  - china owning a port is not actually that big of a deal.
    30% of us ports have a foreign lease.
- what empire actually is
  - china hasn't artifically create famines, invade
    countries and launch coups, launched millions of tons of
    bombs, created slave trades, or create death camps like
    empires of the past
  - It also hasn't occupied XX countries with their military
    through either coercion nor consent, attach conditions
    to their loans, like empires of the present
  - Even today, the repeated accusations of China's military
    aggressions makes me laugh considering the US feels it's
    okay for them to be in near-China airspace but not for
    China to be in near-China airspace
- discursive presumptions
  - arguments that china is the new world empire kind of
    ignore what empire actually is
  - the present state of discourse presumes china is an
    empire and then go on to state conclusions about it as
    proof of the fact. The actual proof is missing, and what
    drives the argument is instead the preconceived belief
    that China is doing some sort of evil.
  -
- concessions and caveats
  - not trying to argue that china is a perfect country
  - e.g. what claim does it actually have to taiwan?
  - yeah I'm sure videos of Chinese business malpractices in
    Africa are true and that's terrible, I literally have no
    justification for that
  - beyond that I am sure that profit-motivated Chinese
    investments can indeed have negative downsides
  - and of course china just being having a ton of people
    and a really, really large economy gives them power. Not
    every country can make the investments that China does
  - but China is not the new world empire. These investments
    are structured for mutual benefit and growth. They
    extend no empire of old, nor do they substantively alter
    the sovereignty or autonomy as do the empires of today.
    Most fundamentally, they don't extend any of the social
    categories that empire needs or produces.
