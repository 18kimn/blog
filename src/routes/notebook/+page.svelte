  <h1>My notes</h1>
  <p>
    This is my notebook, just things I jot into vim as I go
    throughout my day and want to keep thinking about later.
    It's included as part of this website to give additional
    samples of things I'm thinking about. I'm working
    towards turning this into a proper Zettelkasten system.
    Warning: full of typos, inaccuracies, incorrect
    statements, unfinished and run-on sentences, and missing
    citations.
